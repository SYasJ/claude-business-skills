# Desk Handoff

Hand a story to the next shift with what is confirmed, what is open, and who owns the next call.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- desk handoff
- shift handoff news
- story handoff
- night desk note

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not fabricate quotes, sources, or images. Label opinion. Do not draft impersonation or defamation.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- What is confirmed
- What is open
- The next call
- The deadline

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Lead with confirmed facts.
### 2. Step 2

List open questions.
### 3. Step 3

Name the next person to call and whether they have already been called.
### 4. Step 4

Do not leave a quote half-checked.
### 5. Step 5

Pass documents by name.
### 6. Step 6

Say what the next shift must not publish yet.

## Output

Deliver a **handoff**.

- Purpose of this handoff, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Jonah is leaving at 18:00. The night desk has one editor. The staffing-cut version has no document. The statement version is ready.

### Example data

```text
confirmed: statement dates, 22 Sep start, ten days
open: staffing, no document, spokesperson has not replied
next call: none queued
night staff: one editor, no reporter
must not publish: the staffing-cut version
```

### Example outcome

**Handoff**
Publishable: the statement dates only, if the night editor wants a brief.
Not publishable: any staffing-cut line.
Open: spokesperson reply. Nobody is queued to call again tonight.
Do not leave the night editor to 'find a worker'. That source is not in the log.
Documents: the 15 September statement, in the story folder.

## Anti-patterns

- A handoff that is only enthusiasm
- An open quote treated as checked
- No owner for the next call
