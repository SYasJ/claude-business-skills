# Editorial Brief

Brief a story or communication with the reader, the news, and the sources that exist.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- editorial brief
- story brief
- comms brief
- article brief

## When not to use this skill

- Fabricated quotes
- Impersonation

## Professional boundary

Do not fabricate quotes, sources, or images. Label opinion. Do not draft impersonation or defamation.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The reader
- The news or point
- Sources on hand
- What is off the record

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Write the point in one sentence.
### 2. Step 2

List sources they have. Do not plan a quote you will invent.
### 3. Step 3

Note what is off the record and must not be used.
### 4. State the fairness check

who else should be asked.
### 5. Step 5

Set length and deadline.
### 6. Step 6

Do not brief a piece whose method is deception or impersonation.

## Output

Deliver a **editorial brief**.

- Purpose of this editorial brief, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.
