# Compliance Calendar

Build a calendar of obligations the organization already knows it has, with owners and lead time.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- compliance calendar
- obligations calendar
- filing calendar
- compliance dates

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Risk work prioritizes uncertainty. It is not a certification. Do not claim SOC 2, ISO, HIPAA, or similar compliance unless the user has evidence of it.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Known obligations
- Owners
- External dates they have confirmed
- Last year's misses

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Record only obligations they confirmed. Do not invent a filing.
### 2. Step 2

Mark unconfirmed dates as unconfirmed.
### 3. Step 3

Put an internal due date earlier than the external one so review can happen.
### 4. Step 4

Assign an owner and a reviewer.
### 5. Step 5

Note evidence saved when the obligation is met.
### 6. Step 6

Send new-jurisdiction questions to counsel rather than answering them from memory.

## Output

Deliver a **compliance calendar**.

- Purpose of this compliance calendar, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Priya Shah, controller at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a compliance calendar by 30 September 2026. A team wants every possible global filing listed just in case.

### Example data

```text
From: Priya Shah, controller
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A team wants every possible global filing listed just in case.

Known obligations: Vendor Redline Parts. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else
Owners: Priya Shah, controller
External dates they have confirmed: 30 September 2026
Last year's misses: Issue log item 18, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since
```

### Example outcome

**Compliance calendar**
Northline Studio · 14 September 2026 · Due 30 September 2026

**Decision**
A calendar of confirmed obligations, with unknowns flagged for counsel instead of invented.

**Checklist**

- [x] **Known obligations** — Vendor Redline Parts. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else  
      Evidenced in the file
- [x] **Owners** — Priya Shah, controller  
      Evidenced in the file
- [x] **External dates they have confirmed** — 30 September 2026  
      Evidenced in the file
- [ ] **Last year's misses** — Issue log item 18, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since  
      Open — nothing in the file closes this

**The gates this list enforces, in order**

1. Record only obligations they confirmed. Do not invent a filing
2. Mark unconfirmed dates as unconfirmed
3. Put an internal due date earlier than the external one so review can happen
4. Assign an owner and a reviewer
5. Note evidence saved when the obligation is met

**Deliberately not done**
- Invented deadlines.
- A calendar with no owners.
- Dates stored with portal passwords.

**Stop rule**
Do not mark this pack complete while a box above is open. An open box is a finding, not a formality — it is the thing this checklist exists to catch.

Next: Priya Shah closes the open items before 30 September 2026.

## Anti-patterns

- Invented deadlines
- A calendar with no owners
- Dates stored with portal passwords
