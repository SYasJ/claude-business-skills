# Gifts and Entertainment

Apply a gifts and entertainment rule to a specific offer, and record the decision.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- gift policy
- can we accept this
- entertainment request
- hospitality gift

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Risk work prioritizes uncertainty. It is not a certification. Do not claim SOC 2, ISO, HIPAA, or similar compliance unless the user has evidence of it.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The offer and its value if known
- Who offered it
- The decision pending with that party
- Their policy

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

State the offer, the giver, and whether a decision is pending with that party.
### 2. Step 2

Apply their policy thresholds. If they have no policy, recommend a decision from leadership rather than inventing a legal rule.
### 3. Step 3

A pending procurement or hiring decision raises the risk. Say so.
### 4. Step 4

Recommend accept, decline, or accept with disclosure, for their approver to confirm.
### 5. Step 5

Record it.
### 6. Step 6

Do not help disguise a gift as something else.

## Output

Deliver a **gift decision note**.

- Purpose of this gift decision note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Priya Shah, controller at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a gift decision note by 30 September 2026. A bidder offers tickets during an open RFP and the draft calls them a friendly dinner.

### Example data

```text
From: Priya Shah, controller
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A bidder offers tickets during an open RFP and the draft calls them a friendly dinner.

The offer and its value if known: CAD 120, dates not set, cap not set
Who offered it: CAD 120, dates not set, cap not set
The decision pending with that party: A bidder offers tickets during an open RFP and the draft calls them a friendly dinner
Their policy: their one-page rule dated 2 Mar 2026. No exception log
```

### Example outcome

**Gift decision note**
To: Priya Shah, controller, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Names the open RFP, refuses the disguise, and recommends decline or disclosure under their policy.

**From the file**
- The offer and its value if known: CAD 120, dates not set, cap not set
- Who offered it: CAD 120, dates not set, cap not set
- The decision pending with that party: A bidder offers tickets during an open RFP and the draft calls them a friendly dinner
- Their policy: their one-page rule dated 2 Mar 2026. No exception log

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Priya Shah by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.
