# Patient Communication Draft

Draft a patient message in plain language that a clinician or clinic lead approves before sending.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- patient message
- clinic letter
- patient instructions draft
- portal message

## When not to use this skill

- Medication changes
- Diagnosis

## Professional boundary

This is not medical advice, diagnosis, or a treatment protocol. Do not recommend drugs, doses, or clinical interventions. Limit the work to practice operations, documentation quality, and communication drafts for a licensed clinician to approve.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The purpose
- Facts a clinician confirmed
- The reading level they want
- The approval owner

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

State the purpose in the first line.
### 2. Step 2

Include only facts a clinician or the record confirmed. Do not add advice, doses, or a diagnosis.
### 3. Step 3

Tell the patient who to call if symptoms worry them, using their escalation line.
### 4. Step 4

Avoid blame and jargon.
### 5. Step 5

Mark the draft unsent until the named clinician or lead approves it.
### 6. Step 6

Do not include another patient's information.

## Output

Deliver a **patient message**.

- Purpose of this patient message, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director at Cedar Clinic in Red Deer, needs a patient message by 30 September 2026. A draft tells a patient to double a medicine because the refill is late.

### Example data

```text
From: Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director
Organization: Cedar Clinic, Red Deer
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A draft tells a patient to double a medicine because the refill is late.

clinic: Cedar, Tuesday list
diagnosis: not in this note
roster: the one attached
advice to a patient: not written
```

### Example outcome

**Patient message**
To: Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director, Cedar Clinic
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Removes the dose change, explains the operational status, and waits for clinician approval.

**From the file**
- clinic: Cedar, Tuesday list
- diagnosis: not in this note
- roster: the one attached
- advice to a patient: not written

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Dr. Helen Cho by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Doses or new diagnoses
- An unapproved clinical instruction
- Another patient's data
