# Clinic Experience Review

Review a clinic experience problem using waits, communication, and respect, without blaming the patient.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- patient experience
- clinic complaint
- waiting room experience
- visit experience

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not medical advice, diagnosis, or a treatment protocol. Do not recommend drugs, doses, or clinical interventions. Limit the work to practice operations, documentation quality, and communication drafts for a licensed clinician to approve.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The complaint or observation
- Wait data if any
- What staff can change
- Privacy constraints

## Workflow


### 1. Describe the failed moment

wait, confusion, or disrespect.
### 2. Step 2

Use their wait data or mark it unknown.
### 3. Step 3

Separate a capacity problem from a courtesy problem.
### 4. Step 4

Recommend one change staff can make this month.
### 5. Step 5

Do not identify a patient in a broader share-out.
### 6. Step 6

Clinical complaints go to the clinical lead, not to a scripted apology alone.

## Output

Deliver a **clinic experience review**.

- Purpose of this clinic experience review, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director at Cedar Clinic in Red Deer, needs a clinic experience review by 30 September 2026. Patients wait 70 minutes and the draft response tells staff to smile more.

### Example data

```text
From: Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director
Organization: Cedar Clinic, Red Deer
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Patients wait 70 minutes and the draft response tells staff to smile more.

clinic: Cedar, Tuesday list
diagnosis: not in this note
roster: the one attached
advice to a patient: not written
```

### Example outcome

**Clinic experience review**
To: Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director, Cedar Clinic
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Treats the wait as a capacity problem and limits the script to truthful status updates.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| clinic | Cedar, Tuesday list | Needs confirmation |
| diagnosis | not in this note | Carried into the draft |
| roster | the one attached | Carried into the draft |
| advice to a patient | not written | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Describe the failed moment**  
wait, confusion, or disrespect.

**2. Use their wait data or mark it unknown**

**3. Separate a capacity problem from a courtesy problem**

**4. Recommend one change staff can make this month**

**5. Do not identify a patient in a broader share-out**

**Deliberately not done**
- Blaming the patient.
- Identifying a patient in a public note.
- A courtesy script for a capacity failure.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Dr. Helen Cho by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Blaming the patient
- Identifying a patient in a public note
- A courtesy script for a capacity failure
