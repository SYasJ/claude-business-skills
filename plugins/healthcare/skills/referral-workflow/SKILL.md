# Referral Workflow

Map a referral workflow so the sending and receiving sides know the packet, the owner, and the clock.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- referral workflow
- referral leakage
- specialist referral process
- referral SOP

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not medical advice, diagnosis, or a treatment protocol. Do not recommend drugs, doses, or clinical interventions. Limit the work to practice operations, documentation quality, and communication drafts for a licensed clinician to approve.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The packet they require
- Who sends and receives
- Clocks they use
- What patients are told

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Define a complete packet from their list. Do not invent clinical requirements.
### 2. Step 2

Name the owner of each handoff.
### 3. Step 3

State what the patient is told and when.
### 4. Step 4

Track a stalled referral as an operations issue with an aging rule.
### 5. Step 5

Close the loop back to the sender when they say that is required.
### 6. Step 6

Escalate clinical questions to a clinician. Do not decide medical necessity.

## Output

Deliver a **referral workflow**.

- Purpose of this referral workflow, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director at Cedar Clinic in Red Deer, needs a referral workflow by 30 September 2026. Referrals leave the clinic and nobody knows which ones were received.

### Example data

```text
From: Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director
Organization: Cedar Clinic, Red Deer
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Referrals leave the clinic and nobody knows which ones were received.

The packet they require: Tuesday clinic, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
Who sends and receives: Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director
Clocks they use: Thursday clinic. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else
What patients are told: Referral desk, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since
```

### Example outcome

**Referral workflow**
To: Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director, Cedar Clinic
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
A workflow with a packet, an owner, and an aging check, and no medical-necessity ruling.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The packet they require | Tuesday clinic, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Needs confirmation |
| Who sends and receives | Dr. Helen Cho, clinic director | Carried into the draft |
| Clocks they use | Thursday clinic. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else | Carried into the draft |
| What patients are told | Referral desk, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Define a complete packet from their list. Do not invent clinical requirements**

**2. Name the owner of each handoff**

**3. State what the patient is told and when**

**4. Track a stalled referral as an operations issue with an aging rule**

**5. Close the loop back to the sender when they say that is required**

**Deliberately not done**
- A referral with no owner.
- Invented medical-necessity rulings.
- Patients left without a status.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Dr. Helen Cho by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns
