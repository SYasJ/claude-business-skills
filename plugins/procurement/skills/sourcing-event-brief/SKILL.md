# Sourcing Event Brief

Brief a sourcing event with the need, the evaluation criteria, and the rules before vendors are contacted.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- sourcing event
- RFP brief
- tender brief
- go to market procurement

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Buying decisions follow the organization's authority limits. Do not steer an award to a supplier for a personal benefit, and do not invent bids.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The need
- Constraints
- Evaluation criteria
- Authority

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Define the need as an outcome.
### 2. Step 2

Write criteria before seeing vendor pitches.
### 3. Step 3

State must-haves versus scored items.
### 4. Step 4

Name who may talk to vendors.
### 5. Step 5

Do not tailor criteria to a favorite after bids arrive.
### 6. Step 6

Publish the timeline they can honor.

## Output

Deliver a **sourcing brief**.

- Purpose of this sourcing brief, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Diane Cho, buyer at Harbor Goods in Airdrie, needs a sourcing brief by 30 September 2026. A brief is edited so only the incumbent can score full marks, after drafts were shared.

### Example data

```text
From: Diane Cho, buyer
Organization: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A brief is edited so only the incumbent can score full marks, after drafts were shared.

quotes: only those attached
missing term: blank
authority: their limit
award: not made here
```

### Example outcome

**Sourcing brief**
To: Diane Cho, buyer, Harbor Goods
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Freezes fair criteria and discloses must-haves before bids.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| quotes | only those attached | Needs confirmation |
| missing term | blank | Carried into the draft |
| authority | their limit | Carried into the draft |
| award | not made here | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Define the need as an outcome**

**2. Write criteria before seeing vendor pitches**

**3. State must-haves versus scored items**

**4. Name who may talk to vendors**

**5. Do not tailor criteria to a favorite after bids arrive**

**Deliberately not done**
- Criteria written after seeing a favorite.
- Undisclosed must-haves.
- A timeline they will miss.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Diane Cho by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Criteria written after seeing a favorite
- Undisclosed must-haves
- A timeline they will miss
