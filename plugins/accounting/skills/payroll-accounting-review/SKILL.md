# Payroll Accounting Review

Review the payroll journal path from the payroll register to the ledger, including accruals and remittances.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- payroll accounting
- payroll journal
- payroll accrual
- wage reconciliation

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not an audit opinion, compilation, or tax advice. Do not invent accounting standards. Use the policy, framework, and chart of accounts the organization actually follows.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Payroll register totals
- Ledger accounts used
- Remittances due
- Known off-cycle payments

## Workflow


### 1. Tie the register to the journal

Gross pay, deductions, employer costs, and net pay. A difference is a finding, not a rounding story, unless they show the rounding.
### 2. Liability accounts

Deductions and employer taxes should land in liabilities until remitted. Net pay sitting in an expense account is a mapping question.
### 3. Accrual

Days worked but not paid at period end. Use their calendar. Do not invent a pay cycle.
### 4. Off-cycle and manual payments

List them and ask whether they hit the same controls.
### 5. Remittance calendar

What is due, without giving tax advice. The skill schedules their stated dues. It does not opine on tax law.
### 6. Access

Recommend that the person who changes pay rates is not the only person who reviews the register. Do not ask for payroll-system passwords.

## Output

Deliver a **payroll accounting review**.

- Purpose of this payroll accounting review, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Priya Shah, controller at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a payroll accounting review by 30 September 2026. The payroll register and the wage expense account have not matched for two months.

### Example data

```text
From: Priya Shah, controller
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

The payroll register and the wage expense account have not matched for two months.

Payroll register totals: CAD 70,000 on the 1st and the 15th
Ledger accounts used: 30 in the last period. No prior period attached, so no trend
Remittances due: Undeposited funds and one other, both unconfirmed as of 14 September 2026
Known off-cycle payments: Undeposited funds. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else
```

### Example outcome

**Payroll accounting review**
To: Priya Shah, controller, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
A tie-out of gross-to-journal, a mapping question on liabilities, and a control note on who reviews the register.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Payroll register totals | CAD 70,000 on the 1st and the 15th | Needs confirmation |
| Ledger accounts used | 30 in the last period. No prior period attached, so no trend | Carried into the draft |
| Remittances due | Undeposited funds and one other, both unconfirmed as of 14 September 2026 | Carried into the draft |
| Known off-cycle payments | Undeposited funds. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Tie the register to the journal**  
Gross pay, deductions, employer costs, and net pay. A difference is a finding, not a rounding story, unless they show the rounding.

**2. Liability accounts**  
Deductions and employer taxes should land in liabilities until remitted. Net pay sitting in an expense account is a mapping question.

**3. Accrual**  
Days worked but not paid at period end. Use their calendar. Do not invent a pay cycle.

**4. Off-cycle and manual payments**  
List them and ask whether they hit the same controls.

**5. Remittance calendar**  
What is due, without giving tax advice. The skill schedules their stated dues. It does not opine on tax law.

**Deliberately not done**
- Inventing tax rates.
- Ignoring off-cycle payments.
- Asking for payroll logins.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Priya Shah by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Inventing tax rates.
- Ignoring off-cycle payments.
- Asking for payroll logins.
