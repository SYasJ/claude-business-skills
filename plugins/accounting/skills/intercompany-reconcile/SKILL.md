# Intercompany Reconciliation

Reconcile balances and transactions between entities so the group is not adding numbers that do not eliminate.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- intercompany
- intercompany reconciliation
- elimination entries
- related party balances

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not an audit opinion, compilation, or tax advice. Do not invent accounting standards. Use the policy, framework, and chart of accounts the organization actually follows.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Entities involved
- Balances each side recorded
- In-transit items
- Who approves eliminations

## Workflow


### 1. Match both sides

Entity A receivable against entity B payable, same period. One-sided balances are the work.
### 2. Classify differences

In-transit cash, FX, timing of invoices, or a booking error. Use the user's currency facts. Do not invent rates.
### 3. Profit in inventory

If they sell goods between entities, flag unrealized profit as a question for their policy. Do not compute a tax position.
### 4. Draft the elimination

Show the eliminating lines as a proposal that references both sides.
### 5. Aging of differences

Old intercompany differences are a control failure, not a rounding issue.
### 6. Owner going forward

A monthly match, with a named preparer, beats an annual archaeology project.

## Output

Deliver a **intercompany reconciliation**.

- Purpose of this intercompany reconciliation, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Priya Shah, controller at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs an intercompany reconciliation by 30 September 2026. Two subsidiaries disagree by a material amount on a management fee, and the group close is tomorrow.

### Example data

```text
From: Priya Shah, controller
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Two subsidiaries disagree by a material amount on a management fee, and the group close is tomorrow.

Entities involved: Undeposited funds. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else
Balances each side recorded: one file, dated 14 September 2026. No earlier version attached for comparison
In-transit items: Sales tax payable, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since
Who approves eliminations: Priya Shah, controller
```

### Example outcome

**Intercompany reconciliation**
To: Priya Shah, controller, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Does not force a missing counterparty into existence.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entities involved | Undeposited funds. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else | Needs confirmation |
| Balances each side recorded | one file, dated 14 September 2026. No earlier version attached for comparison | Carried into the draft |
| In-transit items | Sales tax payable, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since | Carried into the draft |
| Who approves eliminations | Priya Shah, controller | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Match both sides**  
Entity A receivable against entity B payable, same period. One-sided balances are the work.

**2. Classify differences**  
In-transit cash, FX, timing of invoices, or a booking error. Use the user's currency facts. Do not invent rates.

**3. Profit in inventory**  
If they sell goods between entities, flag unrealized profit as a question for their policy. Do not compute a tax position.

**4. Draft the elimination**  
Show the eliminating lines as a proposal that references both sides.

**5. Aging of differences**  
Old intercompany differences are a control failure, not a rounding issue.

**Deliberately not done**
- Eliminating a one-sided balance with no counterparty.
- Inventing an FX rate.
- Leaving multi-year differences as 'timing'.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Priya Shah by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Eliminating a one-sided balance with no counterparty.
- Inventing an FX rate.
- Leaving multi-year differences as 'timing'.
