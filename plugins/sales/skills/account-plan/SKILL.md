# Account Plan

Write an account plan for a named customer that focuses on their goals, the whitespace you can evidence, and the next plays.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- account plan
- strategic account
- land and expand plan
- account strategy

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Sell honestly. Do not invent customer proof, discounts, or competitor facts. Do not write deceptive, phishing, or high-pressure scripts.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The customer's stated goals
- Current products and stakeholders
- Whitespace you can evidence
- Risks to the relationship

## Workflow


### 1. Customer goals first

Their goals, not your quota, open the plan.
### 2. Map

Stakeholders you actually know, with roles. Do not invent an org chart.
### 3. Whitespace

Opportunities tied to a goal. A product list is not whitespace.
### 4. Risks

Champion departure, unresolved support issues, or competitive evaluations they mentioned.
### 5. Plays

At most three plays this quarter, each with an owner and a buyer action.
### 6. Internal ask

What the account needs from product or support. No private complaints without a request.

## Output

Deliver a **account plan**.

- Purpose of this account plan, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Samir Qureshi, account executive at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs an account plan by 30 September 2026. An account manager owns a renewal and wants a strategic plan, but the only known goal is 'get through this year's audit'.

### Example data

```text
From: Samir Qureshi, account executive
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

An account manager owns a renewal and wants a strategic plan, but the only known goal is 'get through this year's audit'.

The customer's stated goals: Kite Freight
Whitespace you can evidence: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
Risks to the relationship: Harbor Goods is open. No score in the file
```

### Example outcome

**Account plan**
To: Samir Qureshi, account executive, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
A plan anchored on the audit goal, with one evidenced expansion idea and the rest marked unknown.

**From the file**
- The customer's stated goals: Kite Freight
- Whitespace you can evidence: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
- Risks to the relationship: Harbor Goods is open. No score in the file

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Samir Qureshi by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A plan that is only a quota target.
- Invented stakeholders.
- Twelve plays and no owner.
