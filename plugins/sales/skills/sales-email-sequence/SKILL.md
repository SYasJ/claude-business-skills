# Sales Email Sequence

Write a short, truthful outreach or follow-up sequence that earns a reply without deception.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- sales email
- follow-up sequence
- outreach email
- prospecting note

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Sell honestly. Do not invent customer proof, discounts, or competitor facts. Do not write deceptive, phishing, or high-pressure scripts.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Who the reader is
- The observation that makes this relevant
- The single ask
- Proof you can include

## Workflow


### 1. Relevance

The first lines show why this person, why now, using a real observation. No 'I noticed you are a leader' filler if you noticed nothing.
### 2. One ask

A reply, a 20-minute call, or a referral. Not three asks.
### 3. Proof

One sentence of proof the user can support. No fake mutual connections.
### 4. Length

Short enough to read on a phone. Cut the company history.
### 5. Follow-ups

Two or three notes that add a new fact, not 'bumping this'. Then stop.
### 6. Compliance

No deception about why you are writing. No harvested personal secrets. Respect opt-out language the user must include if they say the law or policy requires it.

## Output

Deliver a **email sequence**.

- Purpose of this email sequence, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Samir Qureshi, account executive at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs an email sequence by 30 September 2026. A rep wants a five-email sequence that pretends the buyer asked for information.

### Example data

```text
From: Samir Qureshi, account executive
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A rep wants a five-email sequence that pretends the buyer asked for information.

account: Harbor Goods
last meeting: 9 Sep 2026, no dated next step
proof: one email
discount asked: 15 percent, not approved
```

### Example outcome

**Draft the reader can send**

Samir Qureshi — Fieldnote
14 September 2026

Hello,

A three-note sequence with a real observation, one ask, and no fake inquiry, plus a stop after the third note. This note uses only the facts in the file from 14 September 2026. It does not add a result, a quote, or a discount that was not supplied.

The open point is still open. I will confirm it before 30 September 2026.

Samir Qureshi
account executive, Fieldnote
