# First Ten Customers

List the first customers they can name, and the ones that are still wishes.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- first customers
- who will buy
- design partners
- early customer list

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Startup advice is a set of choices, not a promise of funding or growth. Do not invent traction, customers, or investor interest.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Names they have talked to
- Who paid
- Who said no
- The offer

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Split paid, talking, and no.
### 2. Step 2

A wish with no conversation is not a prospect.
### 3. Step 3

Use their words for why someone paid.
### 4. Step 4

Do not add logos.
### 5. Step 5

Say what the offer was.
### 6. Step 6

Count only rows they named.

## Output

Deliver a **customer list**.

- Purpose of this customer list, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

A deck says ten customers. Four shops pay. Six names are on a whiteboard. Mara has not spoken to those six. The offer is $49 a month.

### Example data

```text
paid: Harbor Goods, Cedar Clinic front desk, Lantern Inn shop, a fourth shop she named as Birch Books
wish list: 6 names, no conversation logged
offer: $49 a month
why Harbor pays: Saturday list, Mara's note of their words
```

### Example outcome

**Customers**
Paying: four. Harbor Goods, Cedar Clinic front desk, Lantern Inn shop, Birch Books.
Harbor's reason, in her note: the Saturday list. Do not invent reasons for the other three.
The six names are not customers and not a pipeline. No conversation is logged.
The deck's ten is wrong. The count is four.

## Anti-patterns

- Logos they did not earn
- A wish counted as a pipeline
- A reason they invented
