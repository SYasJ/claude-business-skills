# Unit Economics

Calculate contribution economics for one real unit the business sells, and show which assumption dominates.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- unit economics
- contribution margin
- CAC payback
- do we make money per customer

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not investment, tax, or financial advice. Do not invent rates of return, tax rates, or valuation multiples. A qualified finance professional must review any decision that moves money.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The unit: customer, order, location, or contract
- Price and direct costs the user can support
- Acquisition cost definition
- Retention or repeat evidence, if any

## Workflow


### 1. Define the unit

Say exactly what one unit is. Mixing orders and customers in one margin is how teams fool themselves.
### 2. Build contribution

Price minus costs that vary with the unit. Keep fixed overhead out of the unit and show it separately.
### 3. Treat acquisition honestly

Include the costs the user says are required to win the unit. Do not ignore discounts and onboarding if they are real.
### 4. Show payback only if retention is known

If retention is a guess, label payback as illustrative and do not lead with it.
### 5. Sensitivity

Name the one assumption that swings the answer. Recommend improving that input, not decorating the model.
### 6. Decision

Say whether the unit, on the user's numbers, funds its own acquisition and delivery. Do not invent a benchmark to declare victory.

## Output

Deliver a **unit economics sheet**.

- Purpose of this unit economics sheet, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs an unit economics sheet by 30 September 2026. A subscription team wants to know if a new annual plan clears contribution after onboarding labor.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A subscription team wants to know if a new annual plan clears contribution after onboarding labor.

The unit: customer, order, location, or contract: customer: in the file; order: not in the file; location: open; contract: in the file
Price and direct costs the user can support: CAD 49
Acquisition cost definition: CAD 18 direct. Overhead not in this line
Retention or repeat evidence, if any: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
```

### Example outcome

**Unit economics sheet**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Defines the customer-year, keeps overhead out, and shows payback only to the extent retention evidence exists.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The unit: customer, order, location, or contract | customer: in the file; order: not in the file; location: open; contract: in the file | Needs confirmation |
| Price and direct costs the user can support | CAD 49 | Carried into the draft |
| Acquisition cost definition | CAD 18 direct. Overhead not in this line | Carried into the draft |
| Retention or repeat evidence, if any | one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026 | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Define the unit**  
Say exactly what one unit is. Mixing orders and customers in one margin is how teams fool themselves.

**2. Build contribution**  
Price minus costs that vary with the unit. Keep fixed overhead out of the unit and show it separately.

**3. Treat acquisition honestly**  
Include the costs the user says are required to win the unit. Do not ignore discounts and onboarding if they are real.

**4. Show payback only if retention is known**  
If retention is a guess, label payback as illustrative and do not lead with it.

**5. Sensitivity**  
Name the one assumption that swings the answer. Recommend improving that input, not decorating the model.

**Deliberately not done**
- A lifetime value built on an invented retention curve.
- Forgetting discounts, refunds, or implementation cost.
- Comparing the result to a generic SaaS benchmark from memory.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A lifetime value built on an invented retention curve.
- Forgetting discounts, refunds, or implementation cost.
- Comparing the result to a generic SaaS benchmark from memory.
