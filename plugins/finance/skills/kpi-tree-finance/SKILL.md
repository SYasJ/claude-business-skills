# Finance KPI Tree

Break a financial outcome into drivers the operator can influence, and stop at metrics someone owns.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- KPI tree
- driver tree
- what drives margin
- finance metrics tree

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not investment, tax, or financial advice. Do not invent rates of return, tax rates, or valuation multiples. A qualified finance professional must review any decision that moves money.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The top outcome
- The operating levers the team controls
- Metrics they can actually extract
- Owners

## Workflow


### 1. Start at the outcome

Cash, contribution, or revenue quality. One top node.
### 2. Decompose mathematically

Each level should explain the level above. If a metric does not connect, cut it.
### 3. Stop at ownership

A driver with no owner is a decoration. Name the owner or stop decomposing.
### 4. Mark leading versus lagging

The tree should show what the team can see before the month closes.
### 5. Note data gaps

A missing driver is a measurement task, not a fake number.
### 6. Tie to the scorecard

Recommend which nodes appear weekly and which appear monthly.

## Output

Deliver a **finance KPI tree**.

- Purpose of this finance KPI tree, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a finance KPI tree by 30 September 2026. A COO wants to know which weekly numbers explain monthly gross margin.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A COO wants to know which weekly numbers explain monthly gross margin.

The top outcome: A COO wants to know which weekly numbers explain monthly gross margin. Stated once, in the ask. Not written down anywhere else
The operating levers the team controls: two people on shift, one off
Metrics they can actually extract: plan 150, actual 85
Owners: Mara Chen, founder
```

### Example outcome

**Finance kpi tree**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
A tree from gross margin to a few owned drivers, with data gaps called out and a weekly subset named.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The top outcome | A COO wants to know which weekly numbers explain monthly gross margin. Stated once, in the ask. Not written down anywhere else | Needs confirmation |
| The operating levers the team controls | two people on shift, one off | Carried into the draft |
| Metrics they can actually extract | plan 150, actual 85 | Carried into the draft |
| Owners | Mara Chen, founder | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Start at the outcome**  
Cash, contribution, or revenue quality. One top node.

**2. Decompose mathematically**  
Each level should explain the level above. If a metric does not connect, cut it.

**3. Stop at ownership**  
A driver with no owner is a decoration. Name the owner or stop decomposing.

**4. Mark leading versus lagging**  
The tree should show what the team can see before the month closes.

**5. Note data gaps**  
A missing driver is a measurement task, not a fake number.

**Deliberately not done**
- A mind map of every metric the company has ever tracked.
- Drivers that do not add up to the parent.
- No owners.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A mind map of every metric the company has ever tracked.
- Drivers that do not add up to the parent.
- No owners.
