# Sensitivity and Scenarios

Show how a model moves when a few inputs move, without pretending the spreadsheet is a crystal ball.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- sensitivity analysis
- what if this input changes
- tornado chart
- scenario versus sensitivity

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not investment, tax, or financial advice. Do not invent rates of return, tax rates, or valuation multiples. A qualified finance professional must review any decision that moves money.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The model outcome that matters
- The inputs the user can actually vary
- A base case from their numbers
- The range they consider plausible

## Workflow


### 1. Pick the outcome

Cash, margin, or runway. One outcome per pass.
### 2. Vary one input at a time first

That is a sensitivity. Combinations are scenarios and should be named, not hidden in a data table.
### 3. Use their ranges

Do not widen a range to make a picture look dramatic.
### 4. Rank the drivers

Which input moves the outcome most across the stated range.
### 5. Tell them what not to precise

If the top driver is a guess, more decimal places will not help.
### 6. Recommend a measurement

The useful next step is often to learn the top driver, not to add more tabs.

## Output

Deliver a **sensitivity note**.

- Purpose of this sensitivity note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a sensitivity note by 30 September 2026. A launch model depends on conversion and fulfillment cost, and the team is arguing about formatting rather than drivers.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A launch model depends on conversion and fulfillment cost, and the team is arguing about formatting rather than drivers.

cash: the counted figure in the ask, one entity
maybe receipt: not in the bank
buffer: the one they named
new spend: not in the base case
```

### Example outcome

**Sensitivity note**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
A one-way sensitivity on the user's ranges, the dominant driver, and a recommendation to measure that driver before adding detail.

**From the file**
- cash: the counted figure in the ask, one entity
- maybe receipt: not in the bank
- buffer: the one they named
- new spend: not in the base case

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A tornado built from invented ranges.
- Calling a one-way table a scenario plan.
- False precision.
