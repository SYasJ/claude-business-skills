# Forecast Accuracy Review

Measure how forecasts missed, separate bias from noise, and change the forecasting habit rather than the template.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- forecast accuracy
- why is the forecast always wrong
- forecast bias
- prediction error

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not investment, tax, or financial advice. Do not invent rates of return, tax rates, or valuation multiples. A qualified finance professional must review any decision that moves money.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Prior forecasts and actuals
- The grain: week, month, product, or team
- Known one-off events
- Who owns the forecast

## Workflow


### 1. Choose the grain

Accuracy at the company level can hide a biased team. Use the grain the decision needs.
### 2. Measure error and bias

Direction matters. A forecast that is always high is a different problem from one that jumps around.
### 3. Exclude explained one-offs only if the user identifies them

Do not scrub the record to make the team look better.
### 4. Find the habit

Sandbagging, hockey sticks, or ignored pipeline. Recommend one habit change.
### 5. Do not add a new model first

If the inputs are political, a fancier model will be political too.
### 6. Set a review

Compare the next two cycles to this baseline and stop there.

## Output

Deliver a **forecast accuracy review**.

- Purpose of this forecast accuracy review, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a forecast accuracy review by 30 September 2026. Revenue forecasts have been high four months in a row and the team wants a new tool.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Revenue forecasts have been high four months in a row and the team wants a new tool.

Prior forecasts and actuals: plan 120, no second scenario attached
The grain: week, month, product, or team: week: in the file; month: not in the file; product: open; team: in the file
Known one-off events: Harbor & Co receipt. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else
Who owns the forecast: plan 120, no second scenario attached
```

### Example outcome

**Forecast accuracy review**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Shows the directional bias, names the habit, and delays a tooling recommendation until the habit changes.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prior forecasts and actuals | plan 120, no second scenario attached | Needs confirmation |
| The grain: week, month, product, or team | week: in the file; month: not in the file; product: open; team: in the file | Carried into the draft |
| Known one-off events | Harbor & Co receipt. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else | Carried into the draft |
| Who owns the forecast | plan 120, no second scenario attached | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Choose the grain**  
Accuracy at the company level can hide a biased team. Use the grain the decision needs.

**2. Measure error and bias**  
Direction matters. A forecast that is always high is a different problem from one that jumps around.

**3. Exclude explained one-offs only if the user identifies them**  
Do not scrub the record to make the team look better.

**4. Find the habit**  
Sandbagging, hockey sticks, or ignored pipeline. Recommend one habit change.

**5. Do not add a new model first**  
If the inputs are political, a fancier model will be political too.

**Deliberately not done**
- A single MAPE number with no bias view.
- Deleting inconvenient misses.
- Buying software before fixing the habit.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A single MAPE number with no bias view.
- Deleting inconvenient misses.
- Buying software before fixing the habit.
