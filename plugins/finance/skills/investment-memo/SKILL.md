# Internal Investment Memo

Write an internal memo for spending scarce cash on a bet, with the downside written in the same size font as the upside.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- investment memo
- should we fund this bet
- internal investment paper
- resource bet memo

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not investment, tax, or financial advice. Do not invent rates of return, tax rates, or valuation multiples. A qualified finance professional must review any decision that moves money.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The bet
- Cash and people required
- Evidence already in hand
- What failure looks like

## Workflow


### 1. State the bet

Customer, offer, and the result that would make this a success, in the user's terms.
### 2. Show evidence and gaps

What has been seen, and what is still a hope. Do not promote hope to evidence.
### 3. Cost the full load

People, cash, and the work that will be delayed. Opportunity cost is part of the price.
### 4. Write the downside

The likely way it fails and the cash already spent by then. Include a stop rule.
### 5. Recommend fund, stage, or decline

Staging is the default when evidence is thin.
### 6. Keep valuation language out unless the user is pricing an external instrument

This is an internal allocation memo, not a stock tip.

## Output

Deliver a **internal investment memo**.

- Purpose of this internal investment memo, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs an internal investment memo by 30 September 2026. A product leader wants headcount for a new segment and has three design-partner conversations, none paid.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A product leader wants headcount for a new segment and has three design-partner conversations, none paid.

cash: the counted figure in the ask, one entity
maybe receipt: not in the bank
buffer: the one they named
new spend: not in the base case
```

### Example outcome

**Internal investment memo**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Calls the conversations evidence of interest, not of demand, and stages spend behind a paid pilot.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cash | the counted figure in the ask, one entity | Needs confirmation |
| maybe receipt | not in the bank | Carried into the draft |
| buffer | the one they named | Carried into the draft |
| new spend | not in the base case | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. State the bet**  
Customer, offer, and the result that would make this a success, in the user's terms.

**2. Show evidence and gaps**  
What has been seen, and what is still a hope. Do not promote hope to evidence.

**3. Cost the full load**  
People, cash, and the work that will be delayed. Opportunity cost is part of the price.

**4. Write the downside**  
The likely way it fails and the cash already spent by then. Include a stop rule.

**5. Recommend fund, stage, or decline**  
Staging is the default when evidence is thin.

**Deliberately not done**
- A pitch that only has an upside case.
- Ignoring the projects the bet will delay.
- Dressing an internal spend as if it were a public-market recommendation.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A pitch that only has an upside case.
- Ignoring the projects the bet will delay.
- Dressing an internal spend as if it were a public-market recommendation.
