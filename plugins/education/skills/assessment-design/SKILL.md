# Assessment Design

Design an assessment that matches the objective and resists cheating without becoming a trap.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- design an assessment
- quiz design
- test blueprint
- check for understanding

## When not to use this skill

- Completing graded work for a student
- Covert exam surveillance

## Professional boundary

Learning design supports the instructor. Do not complete graded work for a student or help anyone cheat. Do not invent accreditation requirements.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The objectives
- The format
- The time
- Integrity constraints they care about

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Map every item to an objective. Unmapped items are cut.
### 2. Step 2

Prefer a task that resembles the real performance when that is possible.
### 3. Step 3

Write a rubric or answer key from the objective, not from trick wording.
### 4. Step 4

Include a reasonable time box.
### 5. State the integrity rules they want

open notes or not. Do not design a surveillance product.
### 6. Step 6

This skill does not write answers for a student to submit as their own.

## Output

Deliver a **assessment**.

- Purpose of this assessment, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mark Ellison, program chair at Riverbend College in Lethbridge, needs an assessment by 30 September 2026. A manager wants an assessment that catches cheaters by using hidden webcams.

### Example data

```text
From: Mark Ellison, program chair
Organization: Riverbend College, Lethbridge
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A manager wants an assessment that catches cheaters by using hidden webcams.

course: the one named
section: the one they teach
student submission: not written for them
due: 30 Sep 2026
```

### Example outcome

**Assessment**
To: Mark Ellison, program chair, Riverbend College
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Do not require covert cameras.

**From the file**
- course: the one named
- section: the one they teach
- student submission: not written for them
- due: 30 Sep 2026

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Mark Ellison by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Trick questions with no objective
- A cheating service
- Surveillance as the assessment
