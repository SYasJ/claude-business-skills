# Pipeline Incident

Write a pipeline failure from the log lines the user has, with the hold and the rerun owner.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- pipeline failed
- data job down
- ETL incident
- broken load

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent numbers. If a source file is missing, say so. Distinguish observation from inference. Do not re-identify private data to make a point.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The job name
- The error line they copied
- What is stale
- Who reruns it

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Quote the error they pasted. Do not invent a stack.
### 2. Step 2

Say which table is stale and as of when.
### 3. State the hold

who should not use the table.
### 4. Step 4

Name the rerun owner.
### 5. Step 5

Separate a late file from a bad transform if the log shows which.
### 6. Step 6

Do not include credentials from the log.

## Output

Deliver a **pipeline note**.

- Purpose of this pipeline note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

orders_daily failed this morning. Noah pasted one error line. The sales dashboard refreshed anyway and still shows yesterday's subtitle as today.

### Example data

```text
job: orders_daily
error line pasted: 15 Sep 2026 05:12 ERROR missing file s3://harbor/orders/2026-09-14.csv
table: analytics.orders_daily
last good load: 14 Sep 2026 05:40, covering 13 Sep
dashboard: refreshed 15 Sep 06:05, subtitle says 15 Sep
rerun owner: Noah Berger
credentials in the paste: none
```

### Example outcome

**Pipeline note**
orders_daily is stale. Last good load covers 13 September, loaded 14 September 05:40.
Error on file: missing 2026-09-14.csv at 05:12. No other cause is in the paste.
Hold: do not use the dashboard figure labeled 15 September. The refresh did not bring new orders.
Rerun: Noah, after the file is actually there. Do not rerun against a missing path and call it fixed.
Next: Jonah changes the subtitle to the last good day before the 09:00 sales meeting.

## Anti-patterns

- A guessed root cause
- A silent rerun
- Credentials copied into the note
