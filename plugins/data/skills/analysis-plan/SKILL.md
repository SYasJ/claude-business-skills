# Analysis Plan

Plan an analysis so the question, the data, and the decision rule are fixed before the slicing starts.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- analysis plan
- data analysis request
- what should we analyze
- analytics brief

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent numbers. If a source file is missing, say so. Distinguish observation from inference. Do not re-identify private data to make a point.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The decision
- The data available
- The comparison they care about
- The deadline

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Restate the decision. An analysis with no decision is a tour.
### 2. Write the comparison

against what period, segment, or control.
### 3. Step 3

List the data you have and the data you do not. Do not plan around a table nobody can access.
### 4. Step 4

Pre-commit the cut that would change the decision.
### 5. Step 5

Name biases in the sample the user described.
### 6. Step 6

Set the deliverable as a memo, not a notebook dump, unless they asked for the notebook too.

## Output

Deliver a **analysis plan**.

- Purpose of this analysis plan, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Noah Berger, data lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs an analysis plan by 30 September 2026. A team wants to know why conversion fell and plans to look at twelve dimensions with no primary comparison.

### Example data

```text
From: Noah Berger, data lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A team wants to know why conversion fell and plans to look at twelve dimensions with no primary comparison.

The decision: A team wants to know why conversion fell and plans to look at twelve dimensions with no primary comparison
The data available: orders_daily, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
The comparison they care about: orders_daily, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
The deadline: 30 September 2026
```

### Example outcome

**Analysis plan**
To: Noah Berger, data lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
A plan with one primary comparison, the missing data called out, and a decision rule written first.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The decision | A team wants to know why conversion fell and plans to look at twelve dimensions with no primary comparison | Needs confirmation |
| The data available | orders_daily, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Carried into the draft |
| The comparison they care about | orders_daily, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Carried into the draft |
| The deadline | 30 September 2026 | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Restate the decision. An analysis with no decision is a tour**

**2. Write the comparison**  
against what period, segment, or control.

**3. List the data you have and the data you do not. Do not plan around a table nobody can access**

**4. Pre-commit the cut that would change the decision**

**5. Name biases in the sample the user described**

**Deliberately not done**
- Slicing until a flattering story appears.
- Assuming a dataset you cannot see.
- A notebook with no decision.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Noah Berger by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Slicing until a flattering story appears
- Assuming a dataset you cannot see
- A notebook with no decision
