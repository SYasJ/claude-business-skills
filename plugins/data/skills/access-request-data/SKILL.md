# Data Access Request

Triage an internal request for data the company already holds, against the approver they name.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- data access request
- who can see this table
- internal data request
- warehouse access

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent numbers. If a source file is missing, say so. Distinguish observation from inference. Do not re-identify private data to make a point.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Who is asking
- The table
- Why
- The approver role in their policy

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Record the asker, the table, and the why.
### 2. Step 2

Check the approver they said their policy requires.
### 3. Step 3

Do not grant access yourself.
### 4. Step 4

Minimize columns. Ask if the whole table is needed.
### 5. Step 5

Flag personal columns.
### 6. Step 6

If the why is missing, the request waits.

## Output

Deliver a **access note**.

- Purpose of this access note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

An analyst asked Noah for the full tickets table, including home addresses, to 'get a feel for the voice'. Their policy says the privacy lead approves personal columns. That role is vacant.

### Example data

```text
asker: Sam Okonkwo, analyst
table: support.tickets
why: get a feel for the voice
columns requested: all
personal columns in the table: email, home address
approver in policy: privacy lead
privacy lead: vacant
Noah's authority: he cannot approve his own pipeline, and he is not the privacy lead
```

### Example outcome

**Access note**
Do not grant the full table.

The why is not a question the table can answer. Send it back.
If they return with a real question, drop email and home address unless the privacy lead approves. That role is vacant, so those columns wait.
Noah does not approve this. Seniority is not the approver.
A shared login is not an option in this note.
Next: Sam rewrites the why, or the request stays closed.

## Anti-patterns

- Access because someone is senior
- A shared login
- Approving your own request
