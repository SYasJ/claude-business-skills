# Data Lineage

Trace a metric to the source tables the user can name, and stop where the trail stops.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- data lineage
- where does this number come from
- metric source
- column lineage

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent numbers. If a source file is missing, say so. Distinguish observation from inference. Do not re-identify private data to make a point.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The metric
- The tables they know
- The transform they can point to
- The gap

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Start at the metric definition they use.
### 2. Step 2

Walk only to tables they named.
### 3. Step 3

Mark the first hop you cannot show.
### 4. Step 4

Do not draw a source you inferred from a column name.
### 5. Step 5

Note if two jobs write the same column.
### 6. Step 6

Give the owner one place to look next.

## Output

Deliver a **lineage note**.

- Purpose of this lineage note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Jonah asked where active_accounts comes from. Noah can point at a dbt model name and then the trail stops. The slide says 'the warehouse'.

### Example data

```text
metric: active_accounts, defined as workspaces with a login on that day
known hop: model fct_active_accounts, owner Noah
source tables named: none
second writer: unknown
slide text: "comes from the warehouse"
```

### Example outcome

**Lineage note**
active_accounts is the count of workspaces with a login that day, per Jonah's definition.
Known hop: fct_active_accounts, owner Noah Berger.
Next hop: not in the file. Do not draw a source table from the column name.
The slide line 'the warehouse' is not a source.
Open: the table under the model, and whether any other job writes active_flag.
Next: Noah names that table before this metric is used in a board pack.

## Anti-patterns

- A full map drawn from guesses
- Ignoring a second writer
- A lineage slide with no table names
