# Segmentation Study

Segment users or customers from supplied data into groups that change an action, not into decorative clusters.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- segmentation
- customer segments
- cluster analysis
- how should we segment

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent numbers. If a source file is missing, say so. Distinguish observation from inference. Do not re-identify private data to make a point.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The action the segment must change
- Available fields
- Sample limits
- Segments they already use

## Workflow


### 1. Start from the action

message, offer, or service model. Segments that do not change an action are cut.
### 2. Step 2

Use fields they have. Do not require a model they cannot run.
### 3. Step 3

Keep the number of segments small enough to operate.
### 4. Step 4

Describe each segment with a rule a teammate can apply, not only a cluster id.
### 5. Step 5

Note sample size. A segment of a handful of rows is a list, not a strategy.
### 6. Step 6

Recommend one test, not an immediate company-wide rewrite of the motion.

## Output

Deliver a **segmentation note**.

- Purpose of this segmentation note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Noah Berger, data lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a segmentation note by 30 September 2026. A model produced eight clusters and the team cannot say what they would do differently for any of them.

### Example data

```text
From: Noah Berger, data lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A model produced eight clusters and the team cannot say what they would do differently for any of them.

The action the segment must change: requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved
Available fields: customers. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else
Sample limits: active_accounts, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
Segments they already use: orders_daily, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
```

### Example outcome

**Segmentation note**
To: Noah Berger, data lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Collapses to a few actionable rules and parks the rest as unusable.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The action the segment must change | requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved | Needs confirmation |
| Available fields | customers. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else | Carried into the draft |
| Sample limits | active_accounts, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Carried into the draft |
| Segments they already use | orders_daily, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Start from the action**  
message, offer, or service model. Segments that do not change an action are cut.

**2. Use fields they have. Do not require a model they cannot run**

**3. Keep the number of segments small enough to operate**

**4. Describe each segment with a rule a teammate can apply, not only a cluster id**

**5. Note sample size. A segment of a handful of rows is a list, not a strategy**

**Deliberately not done**
- Clusters with no action.
- A segment too small to mean anything.
- Invented demographic attributes.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Noah Berger by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Clusters with no action
- A segment too small to mean anything
- Invented demographic attributes
