# Isolation Work Plan Review

Review an isolation or lockout plan for named points and a prove-dead step, without telling anyone to skip it.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- lockout plan
- isolation review
- permit to work review
- energy isolation

## When not to use this skill

- Bypassing lockout or isolation

## Professional boundary

Operational energy advice is not a permit and not a safety case. Do not bypass lockout, isolation, or regulatory limits.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The equipment
- Isolation points they listed
- The prove-dead step
- The issuer

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Check that isolation points are named, not implied.
### 2. Step 2

Require the prove-dead step they use.
### 3. Step 3

Do not suggest a shortcut around a lock or a tag.
### 4. Step 4

Identify a missing point as a stop.
### 5. Step 5

Name the issuer and the worker role they described.
### 6. Step 6

This review is not a permit to start work.

## Output

Deliver a **isolation plan review**.

- Purpose of this isolation plan review, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Devon Hale, operations superintendent at Prairie Line Energy in Grande Prairie, needs an isolation plan review by 30 September 2026. A plan says to isolate 'as usual' and skip the test because the crew is experienced.

### Example data

```text
From: Devon Hale, operations superintendent
Organization: Prairie Line Energy, Grande Prairie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A plan says to isolate 'as usual' and skip the test because the crew is experienced.

meter: the one they named
figure: their sheet
promised date from elsewhere: not in the file
owner: superintendent
```

### Example outcome

**Isolation plan review**
To: Devon Hale, operations superintendent, Prairie Line Energy
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Blocks the skip and requires named points and the test.

**From the file**
- meter: the one they named
- figure: their sheet
- promised date from elsewhere: not in the file
- owner: superintendent

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Devon Hale by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.
