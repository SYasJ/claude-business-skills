# Outage Communication

Draft an outage message with the area, the known cause label, and the next update time.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- outage message
- power outage update
- utility customer message
- restoration update

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Operational energy advice is not a permit and not a safety case. Do not bypass lockout, isolation, or regulatory limits.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The affected area
- What is confirmed
- The next update time
- The approver

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

State who is affected in the terms they confirmed.
### 2. Step 2

Do not guess a cause.
### 3. Step 3

Give the next update time.
### 4. Step 4

Include safety instructions they already approved, such as staying away from downed lines. Do not invent technical bypass steps.
### 5. Step 5

Avoid promising a restoration minute they do not have.
### 6. Step 6

Keep the log of what was said.

## Output

Deliver a **outage message**.

- Purpose of this outage message, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Devon Hale, operations superintendent at Prairie Line Energy in Grande Prairie, needs an outage message by 30 September 2026. A message promises power in 30 minutes because that sounded reassuring.

### Example data

```text
From: Devon Hale, operations superintendent
Organization: Prairie Line Energy, Grande Prairie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A message promises power in 30 minutes because that sounded reassuring.

meter: the one they named
figure: their sheet
promised date from elsewhere: not in the file
owner: superintendent
```

### Example outcome

**Outage message**
To: Devon Hale, operations superintendent, Prairie Line Energy
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Removes the 30-minute promise and commits to a next update.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| meter | the one they named | Needs confirmation |
| figure | their sheet | Carried into the draft |
| promised date from elsewhere | not in the file | Carried into the draft |
| owner | superintendent | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. State who is affected in the terms they confirmed**

**2. Do not guess a cause**

**3. Give the next update time**

**4. Include safety instructions they already approved, such as staying away from downed lines. Do not invent technical bypass steps**

**5. Avoid promising a restoration minute they do not have**

**Deliberately not done**
- A guessed cause.
- A fake restoration minute.
- Bypass instructions for equipment.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Devon Hale by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A guessed cause
- A fake restoration minute
- Bypass instructions for equipment
