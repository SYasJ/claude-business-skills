# Personal OKRs

Set a few personal objectives that fit the week you actually have.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- personal OKRs
- personal goals
- quarterly personal goals
- life planning goals

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Productivity systems serve the person's actual constraints. Do not recommend surveillance of colleagues or hidden monitoring.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The outcomes that matter
- Time available
- Existing commitments
- How you will review

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Choose one to three objectives.
### 2. Step 2

Write key results you can observe.
### 3. Step 3

Check them against the calendar.
### 4. Step 4

Cut goals that require time you do not have.
### 5. Step 5

Set a review.
### 6. Step 6

Do not turn personal goals into a surveillance plan for family or coworkers.

## Output

Deliver a **personal objectives**.

- Purpose of this personal objectives, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

**How this draft was built**

**1. Choose one to three objectives**

**2. Write key results you can observe**

**3. Check them against the calendar**

**4. Cut goals that require time you do not have**

**5. Set a review**

**Deliberately not done**
- Goals that do not fit the calendar.
- Vanity goals with no review.
- Surveillance of other people.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.
