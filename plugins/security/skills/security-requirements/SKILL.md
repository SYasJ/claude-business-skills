# Security Requirements

Write defensive security requirements for a feature so engineering can build controls without exploit instructions.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- security requirements
- secure design requirements
- what security does this need
- abuse cases to defend

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Defensive use only. Do not write exploits, payloads, bypasses, malware, or intrusion steps. Describe controls, ownership, detection, and safe verification.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The feature and its data
- Actors
- Existing controls
- Sensitivity the user described

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

List assets and actors in plain language.
### 2. Write requirements as observable controls

authenticate, authorize, log, limit, and protect data.
### 3. Include failure behavior

deny by default, and what the user sees.
### 4. Step 4

Map each requirement to a test the team can run safely, such as an authorized versus unauthorized check.
### 5. Step 5

Do not include exploit steps, payloads, or bypass instructions.
### 6. Step 6

Name the owner who accepts any requirement they choose to defer.

## Output

Deliver a **security requirements**.

- Purpose of this security requirements, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Aisha Rahman, engineering lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a security requirements by 30 September 2026. A new export feature has no statement about who may export customer data.

### Example data

```text
From: Aisha Rahman, engineering lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A new export feature has no statement about who may export customer data.

The feature and its data: Access review Q3, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
Actors: Aisha Rahman plus two others named in the thread. No distribution list attached
Existing controls: their one-page rule dated 2 Mar 2026. No exception log since
Sensitivity the user described: Endpoint patch ring 2, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since
```

### Example outcome

**Security requirements**
To: Aisha Rahman, engineering lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Requirements for authorization, audit, and a safe allow-and-deny test, with no attack procedure.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The feature and its data | Access review Q3, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Needs confirmation |
| Actors | Aisha Rahman plus two others named in the thread. No distribution list attached | Carried into the draft |
| Existing controls | their one-page rule dated 2 Mar 2026. No exception log since | Carried into the draft |
| Sensitivity the user described | Endpoint patch ring 2, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. List assets and actors in plain language**

**2. Write requirements as observable controls**  
authenticate, authorize, log, limit, and protect data.

**3. Include failure behavior**  
deny by default, and what the user sees.

**4. Map each requirement to a test the team can run safely, such as an authorized versus unauthorized check**

**5. Do not include exploit steps, payloads, or bypass instructions**

**Deliberately not done**
- Exploit steps.
- A requirement list with no tests.
- Deferring auth with no owner.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Aisha Rahman by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Exploit steps
- A requirement list with no tests
- Deferring auth with no owner
