# SERP Gap

Compare the user's page to what they can see on the results page, without inventing ranks.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- SERP gap
- why are we not ranking
- results page review
- competitor page

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not draft cloaking, doorway pages, hidden text, fake reviews, or link schemes. Use only queries and pages the user can show.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The query
- Their page
- What they personally see on the results page
- What they will not copy

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Describe only the results they looked at, with the date.
### 2. Step 2

Do not invent a rank or a search-volume number.
### 3. Step 3

Say what those pages answer that theirs does not.
### 4. Step 4

Recommend a factual gap to fill, not a copy.
### 5. Step 5

Do not copy another site's text.
### 6. Step 6

If they did not look, say so.

## Output

Deliver a **gap note**.

- Purpose of this gap note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Diane searched 'furnace repair Airdrie' on 18 September and looked at the top three results she saw. She did not write down a rank for her own page. Those three pages show a city, a phone, and hours. Hers does not.

### Example data

```text
query: furnace repair Airdrie
date looked: 18 Sep 2026
her page has: origin story
pages she saw: three local service pages with city, phone, hours
her rank: not recorded
volume: not in any export
will not copy: their wording
```

### Example outcome

**Gap note**
No rank. She did not record one. No volume. None was exported.

Gap she can see: those pages state city, phone, and hours. Her furnace page does not.
Fill with her own facts: Airdrie, 403-555-0148, Mon-Sat 08:00-17:00, closed Sunday.
Do not copy their sentences. Do not add a review count she does not have.

## Anti-patterns

- A fake rank
- A copied paragraph
- Volume numbers from memory
