# Search Refresh

Decide whether an old URL should be updated, from the query and the stale claim.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- update this URL
- content refresh SEO
- stale page
- refresh versus new URL

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not draft cloaking, doorway pages, hidden text, fake reviews, or link schemes. Use only queries and pages the user can show.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The URL
- The query
- The stale sentence
- The new fact they can source

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Keep the URL if the query still matches the page's job.
### 2. Step 2

Replace the stale sentence only with the sourced fact.
### 3. Step 3

Put the update date.
### 4. Step 4

A new URL is for a new job, not for a date change.
### 5. Step 5

Do not add a city or a price they cannot source.
### 6. Step 6

Do not cloak the old content for bots.

## Output

Deliver a **refresh note**.

- Purpose of this refresh note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

The page /permits/sidewalk still ranks for a query Diane wants. It says the fee is $50. The 2026 fee sheet says $75. Someone suggested a new URL so the old one can stay.

### Example data

```text
url: /permits/sidewalk
query she still wants: sidewalk display permit Airdrie
stale sentence: fee is $50
new fact: town fee sheet, 1 Jan 2026, $75
new URL suggested: /permits/sidewalk-2026
```

### Example outcome

**Refresh note**
Keep /permits/sidewalk. The query is the same job.
Replace $50 with $75 and cite the fee sheet. Add: updated 20 September 2026.
Do not make /permits/sidewalk-2026. A new URL is a new job. This is not one.
Do not show the old fee to people and the new fee to crawlers. One page, one fee.

## Anti-patterns

- A new URL for the same job
- A silent price change
- Cloaking
