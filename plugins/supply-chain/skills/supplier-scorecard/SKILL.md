# Supplier Scorecard

Score a supplier on the outcomes in the agreement, using evidence rather than the last meeting's mood.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- supplier scorecard
- vendor scorecard
- supplier performance
- supplier review

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Inventory and supplier recommendations depend on the user's lead times and service targets. Do not invent supplier performance.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The contracted outcomes
- Recent evidence
- Volumes
- The internal owner

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Score only contracted outcomes they can evidence.
### 2. Step 2

Separate a one-off miss from a trend.
### 3. Step 3

Include the buyer's own late forecasts if those caused the miss.
### 4. Step 4

Recommend a conversation, a corrective plan, or a sourcing question.
### 5. Step 5

Do not invent a penalty.
### 6. Step 6

Share the score with the supplier only if the user wants a supplier-facing version, and keep it factual.

## Output

Deliver a **supplier scorecard**.

- Purpose of this supplier scorecard, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Diane Cho, supply lead at Harbor Goods in Airdrie, needs a supplier scorecard by 30 September 2026. A supplier is blamed for shortages after the forecast doubled with no notice.

### Example data

```text
From: Diane Cho, supply lead
Organization: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A supplier is blamed for shortages after the forecast doubled with no notice.

The contracted outcomes: unsigned draft, 8 pages, no signature date
Recent evidence: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
The internal owner: Diane Cho, supply lead
```

### Example outcome

**Supplier scorecard**
Harbor Goods · 14 September 2026 · Due 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Records the forecast change as a buyer cause and limits the supplier miss to evidenced gaps.

| Item | Figure in the file | Call | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cedar Clinic | plan 120, actual 90 | Use | Both sides of the comparison are in the file |
| Fieldnote | score 62 | Report, do not benchmark | One score is a reading, not a baseline |
| Missing export | Not in the file | Stop | The cell stays blank until the export arrives |

**How these calls were made**

1. Score only contracted outcomes they can evidence
2. Separate a one-off miss from a trend
3. Include the buyer's own late forecasts if those caused the miss
4. Recommend a conversation, a corrective plan, or a sourcing question
5. Do not invent a penalty

**Deliberately not done**
- A mood score.
- Invented penalties.
- Ignoring buyer-caused misses.

**Open items**
- The missing export is the binding constraint. No figure was estimated to fill its place.
- Any row marked *Report, do not benchmark* needs a second period before it can carry a trend.

Next: Diane Cho attaches the missing export, or the cell stays blank. Due 30 September 2026.

## Anti-patterns

- A mood score
- Invented penalties
- Ignoring buyer-caused misses
