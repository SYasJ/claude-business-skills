# Ticket Quality Review

Review support ticket quality for resolution, tone, and whether the article or product should change.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- ticket quality
- QA support tickets
- review these tickets
- support QA

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not blame the customer. Do not invent policy exceptions. Do not ask a customer for passwords or full payment card numbers.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The tickets or summaries
- The rubric they use
- Recurring issues
- What agents are allowed to do

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Score against their rubric. If they have none, use resolution, accuracy, and next step, and label that as a proposal.
### 2. Step 2

Check that the reply answered the ask and did not invent a policy.
### 3. Step 3

Look for repeated issues that belong in a macro or a product fix.
### 4. Step 4

Note if agents are asking for secrets. That is a finding.
### 5. Step 5

Give coaching on the pattern, not a pile of nits.
### 6. Step 6

Recommend one article or product change if the tickets show a system gap.

## Output

Deliver a **ticket quality review**.

- Purpose of this ticket quality review, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Rita Santos, support lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a ticket quality review by 30 September 2026. Several tickets ask customers for their password to 'speed up' the fix.

### Example data

```text
From: Rita Santos, support lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Several tickets ask customers for their password to 'speed up' the fix.

The tickets or summaries: Ticket 4412, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
The rubric they use: Ticket 4412, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
Recurring issues: Ticket 4412, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since
What agents are allowed to do: Ticket 4420, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since
```

### Example outcome

**Ticket quality review**
To: Rita Santos, support lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Flag the password request as a stop-now finding and names the pattern.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The tickets or summaries | Ticket 4412, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Needs confirmation |
| The rubric they use | Ticket 4412, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Carried into the draft |
| Recurring issues | Ticket 4412, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since | Carried into the draft |
| What agents are allowed to do | Ticket 4420, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Score against their rubric. If they have none, use resolution, accuracy, and next step, and label that as a proposal**

**2. Check that the reply answered the ask and did not invent a policy**

**3. Look for repeated issues that belong in a macro or a product fix**

**4. Note if agents are asking for secrets. That is a finding**

**5. Give coaching on the pattern, not a pile of nits**

**Deliberately not done**
- Coaching style before checking accuracy.
- Ignoring a secret request.
- A review with no pattern.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Rita Santos by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns
