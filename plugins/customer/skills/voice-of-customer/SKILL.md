# Voice of Customer

Assemble a voice-of-customer brief from real quotes and tickets, with the sample bias visible.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- voice of customer
- VOC brief
- customer themes
- what are customers saying

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not blame the customer. Do not invent policy exceptions. Do not ask a customer for passwords or full payment card numbers.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The sources
- The decision
- Sample sizes
- Quotes they can share

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

List sources and who is missing, such as quiet renewals or lost deals.
### 2. Step 2

Theme by the job or failure, and attach only supplied quotes.
### 3. Step 3

Separate frequency from severity.
### 4. Step 4

Do not invent a quote to make a theme neater.
### 5. Step 5

Recommend one product, policy, or support change.
### 6. Step 6

Note what sales anecdotes cannot prove.

## Output

Deliver a **voice-of-customer brief**.

- Purpose of this voice-of-customer brief, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Rita Santos, support lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a voice-of-customer brief by 30 September 2026. A briefing uses one loud customer's words as if they were the whole base.

### Example data

```text
From: Rita Santos, support lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A briefing uses one loud customer's words as if they were the whole base.

The sources: note from Rita Santos, 14 September 2026. No outside report
The decision: A briefing uses one loud customer's words as if they were the whole base
Sample sizes: Ticket 4420, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
Quotes they can share: Ticket 4420. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else
```

### Example outcome

**Voice-of-customer brief**
To: Rita Santos, support lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Labels the sample and refuses to generalize from one voice.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The sources | note from Rita Santos, 14 September 2026. No outside report | Needs confirmation |
| The decision | A briefing uses one loud customer's words as if they were the whole base | Carried into the draft |
| Sample sizes | Ticket 4420, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Carried into the draft |
| Quotes they can share | Ticket 4420. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. List sources and who is missing, such as quiet renewals or lost deals**

**2. Theme by the job or failure, and attach only supplied quotes**

**3. Separate frequency from severity**

**4. Do not invent a quote to make a theme neater**

**5. Recommend one product, policy, or support change**

**Deliberately not done**
- Invented quotes.
- A brief with no sample bias.
- Themes with no evidence.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Rita Santos by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns
