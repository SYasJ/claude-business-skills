# Complaint Root Cause

Analyze a cluster of complaints to the cause the company can fix, without dismissing the customer.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- complaint analysis
- root cause of complaints
- repeated complaints
- why are tickets rising

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not blame the customer. Do not invent policy exceptions. Do not ask a customer for passwords or full payment card numbers.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The complaint cluster
- Volumes
- What agents already do
- Recent changes

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Define the cluster with their labels and volumes.
### 2. Step 2

Read for the failed job, not for the customer's tone.
### 3. Step 3

Separate a product defect, a policy surprise, and an expectation set by marketing.
### 4. Step 4

Check a recent change that matches the timing.
### 5. Recommend one fix

policy, product, or message.
### 6. Step 6

Do not blame the customer in the write-up.

## Output

Deliver a **complaint analysis**.

- Purpose of this complaint analysis, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Rita Santos, support lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a complaint analysis by 30 September 2026. Complaints rose after a pricing page started hiding a fee.

### Example data

```text
From: Rita Santos, support lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Complaints rose after a pricing page started hiding a fee.

The complaint cluster: Ticket 4412, first seen 14 September 2026. No root cause recorded yet
Volumes: 40 in the last period. No prior period attached, so no trend
What agents already do: Ticket 4420, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since
Recent changes: requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved
```

### Example outcome

**Complaint analysis**
To: Rita Santos, support lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Names the hidden fee as the hypothesis to fix and does not blame the customers for writing in.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The complaint cluster | Ticket 4412, first seen 14 September 2026. No root cause recorded yet | Needs confirmation |
| Volumes | 40 in the last period. No prior period attached, so no trend | Carried into the draft |
| What agents already do | Ticket 4420, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since | Carried into the draft |
| Recent changes | requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Define the cluster with their labels and volumes**

**2. Read for the failed job, not for the customer's tone**

**3. Separate a product defect, a policy surprise, and an expectation set by marketing**

**4. Check a recent change that matches the timing**

**5. Recommend one fix**  
policy, product, or message.

**Deliberately not done**
- Blaming tone.
- A fix that does not match the cause.
- Ignoring a recent change.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Rita Santos by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Blaming tone
- A fix that does not match the cause
