# Customer Health Score

Define a customer health score from signals that predict renewal risk, and show the formula.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- health score
- customer health
- red account logic
- success score

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not blame the customer. Do not invent policy exceptions. Do not ask a customer for passwords or full payment card numbers.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Signals they can collect
- What happened before past churn if known
- Who will act on red
- The formula they use today

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Start from the action a red score triggers. A score with no action is a toy.
### 2. Step 2

Choose signals they can collect without creepy surveillance.
### 3. Step 3

Show the formula. Hidden points are a finding.
### 4. Step 4

Weight only with evidence they have. If they have no history, call the score a hypothesis.
### 5. Step 5

Set a review so a red account gets a human, not only a color.
### 6. Step 6

Do not include sensitive personal data in the score.

## Output

Deliver a **health score definition**.

- Purpose of this health score definition, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Rita Santos, support lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a health score definition by 30 September 2026. A health score marks accounts red and no one has a play for red.

### Example data

```text
From: Rita Santos, support lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A health score marks accounts red and no one has a play for red.

Signals they can collect: Ticket 4420, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
What happened before past churn if known: Ticket 4420, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since
Who will act on red: Rita Santos, support lead
The formula they use today: Ticket 4412, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
```

### Example outcome

**Health score definition**
To: Rita Santos, support lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
A visible formula and a required human play for red, or a recommendation not to launch the score yet.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Signals they can collect | Ticket 4420, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Needs confirmation |
| What happened before past churn if known | Ticket 4420, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since | Carried into the draft |
| Who will act on red | Rita Santos, support lead | Carried into the draft |
| The formula they use today | Ticket 4412, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Start from the action a red score triggers. A score with no action is a toy**

**2. Choose signals they can collect without creepy surveillance**

**3. Show the formula. Hidden points are a finding**

**4. Weight only with evidence they have. If they have no history, call the score a hypothesis**

**5. Set a review so a red account gets a human, not only a color**

**Deliberately not done**
- A hidden formula.
- A score nobody acts on.
- Sensitive personal data as an input.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Rita Santos by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A hidden formula
