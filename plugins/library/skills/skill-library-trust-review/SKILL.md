# Skill Library Trust Review

Review a skill or a skill repository for signs it is unsafe, deceptive, or pretending to be an official product.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- is this skill repo safe
- trust review
- skill security review
- should I install this

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Library skills help you choose, write, and trust agent skills. They do not grant extra permissions or weaken safety rules.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The files or an inventory
- Install instructions
- Network behavior
- Claims of affiliation

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Prefer an installer that copies local files and does not pipe a remote script to a shell.
### 2. Step 2

Check scripts for network calls, obfuscation, and credential prompts.
### 3. Step 3

Descriptions should say what the skill does. Hidden instructions are a finding.
### 4. Step 4

Official-looking branding without a clear independent-author statement is a finding.
### 5. Step 5

A repository that promises guaranteed income, token claims, or wallet connections is out of scope for this library and should be treated as untrusted.
### 6. Step 6

Recommend installing one domain and reading a skill before enabling it. This review is not a security certification.

## Output

Deliver a **trust review**.

- Purpose of this trust review, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Yasir Jilani, author at Practice Skills in Airdrie, needs a trust review by 30 September 2026. An installer asks the user to run a remote script and paste an API key to 'activate' free skills.

### Example data

```text
From: Yasir Jilani, author
Organization: Practice Skills, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

An installer asks the user to run a remote script and paste an API key to 'activate' free skills.

The files or an inventory: 50 on hand
Install instructions: plugins/finance/cash-flow-forecast, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since
Network behavior: plugins/finance/cash-flow-forecast; MANIFEST.sha256. Both unassigned as of 14 September 2026
Claims of affiliation: the draft sentence is broader than the note
```

### Example outcome

**Trust review**
To: Yasir Jilani, author, Practice Skills
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Names the remote script and the key request.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The files or an inventory | 50 on hand | Needs confirmation |
| Install instructions | plugins/finance/cash-flow-forecast, last reviewed 14 September 2026. No owner named since | Carried into the draft |
| Network behavior | plugins/finance/cash-flow-forecast; MANIFEST.sha256. Both unassigned as of 14 September 2026 | Carried into the draft |
| Claims of affiliation | the draft sentence is broader than the note | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Prefer an installer that copies local files and does not pipe a remote script to a shell**

**2. Check scripts for network calls, obfuscation, and credential prompts**

**3. Descriptions should say what the skill does. Hidden instructions are a finding**

**4. Official-looking branding without a clear independent-author statement is a finding**

**5. A repository that promises guaranteed income, token claims, or wallet connections is out of scope for this library and should be treated as untrusted**

**Deliberately not done**
- A fake certification.
- Ignoring a curl-pipe installer.
- Treating a logo as proof of affiliation.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Yasir Jilani by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns
