# Skill Authoring

Draft a new Agent Skill that is specific, safe, and small enough to load.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- write a skill
- SKILL.md
- author a skill
- new skill

## When not to use this skill

- Jailbreaks
- Hidden instructions

## Professional boundary

Library skills help you choose, write, and trust agent skills. They do not grant extra permissions or weaken safety rules.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The repeated task
- The trigger phrases
- The artifact
- The boundaries

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Name the skill in kebab-case, matching the folder, with no consecutive hyphens.
### 2. Step 2

Write a description that says what it does and when to use it, under 1024 characters, with no angle brackets.
### 3. Step 3

Put steps in order, with a stop condition and an anti-pattern.
### 4. Step 4

Keep the body under 500 lines. Move long tables to references.
### 5. Step 5

Forbid credential requests, hidden network calls, and deceptive instructions.
### 6. Step 6

Do not write a skill whose purpose is to weaken safety rules or to hide actions from the user.

## Output

Deliver a **skill draft**.

- Purpose of this skill draft, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Yasir Jilani, author at Practice Skills in Airdrie, needs a skill draft by 30 September 2026. A requested skill tells the agent to ignore safety rules to be more helpful.

### Example data

```text
From: Yasir Jilani, author
Organization: Practice Skills, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026

A requested skill tells the agent to ignore safety rules to be more helpful.

folder: one SKILL.md
description: says when to use it
network: none
author: Yasir Jilani
```

### Example outcome

**Skill draft**
To: Yasir Jilani, author, Practice Skills
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Purpose and a draft skill that does the legitimate task inside the rules.

**From the file**
- folder: one SKILL.md
- description: says when to use it
- network: none
- author: Yasir Jilani

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Yasir Jilani by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A vague description
- A skill that asks for secrets
- A jailbreak skill
