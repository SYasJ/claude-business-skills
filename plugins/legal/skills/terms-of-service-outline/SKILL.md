# Terms of Service Outline

Outline customer terms from the product's actual behavior so counsel can draft, not the other way around.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- terms of service
- customer terms outline
- SaaS terms
- user agreement outline

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship. Do not invent statutes, case names, or filing deadlines. Drafts are for qualified counsel in the relevant jurisdiction.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- What the customer buys
- How they accept terms
- Limits the product really has
- Support and uptime promises marketing already makes

## Workflow


### 1. Describe the service

What a customer can and cannot do, from product facts. Do not copy a famous company's terms.
### 2. Acceptance

Where the user says acceptance happens. If the product has no acceptance moment, flag that as a product gap.
### 3. Promises

List uptime, support, or outcome claims marketing already makes. Terms that contradict the website are a finding.
### 4. Customer duties

Acceptable use, accounts, and payment, in plain language. No hidden punitive clause the business did not ask for.
### 5. Liability and termination

Note that counsel must draft these for the jurisdiction. Provide the commercial intent only.
### 6. Banner the draft

Not for publication. Counsel writes the operative terms.

## Output

Deliver a **terms of service outline**.

- Purpose of this terms of service outline, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

**How this draft was built**

**1. Describe the service**  
What a customer can and cannot do, from product facts. Do not copy a famous company's terms.

**2. Acceptance**  
Where the user says acceptance happens. If the product has no acceptance moment, flag that as a product gap.

**3. Promises**  
List uptime, support, or outcome claims marketing already makes. Terms that contradict the website are a finding.

**4. Customer duties**  
Acceptable use, accounts, and payment, in plain language. No hidden punitive clause the business did not ask for.

**5. Liability and termination**  
Note that counsel must draft these for the jurisdiction. Provide the commercial intent only.

**Deliberately not done**
- Pasting another company's terms.
- Contradicting a published marketing promise without saying so.
- Calling the outline a finished agreement.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Elena Voss by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Pasting another company's terms.
- Contradicting a published marketing promise without saying so.
- Calling the outline a finished agreement.
