# IP Ownership Checklist

List who is supposed to own work product across employees, contractors, and vendors, based on documents the user has.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- IP ownership
- who owns the code
- contractor IP
- work product assignment

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship. Do not invent statutes, case names, or filing deadlines. Drafts are for qualified counsel in the relevant jurisdiction.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Roles involved
- Agreements they have signed, as described
- The work product at issue
- Any open-source components they mentioned

## Workflow


### 1. Inventory the creators

Employees, contractors, agencies, and founders. Ownership follows documents, not assumptions about who paid.
### 2. Match agreements

For each creator type, note whether the user has an assignment or only a handshake. A missing document is the finding.
### 3. Scope of assignment

What the document says is assigned, including improvements and feedback, quoted briefly.
### 4. Third-party code

If they mentioned open source or a vendor toolkit, flag license review. Do not declare a license compatible from memory.
### 5. Gaps

Work done before an agreement, or by a friend, needs a cleanup question for counsel.
### 6. No filings

This skill does not file trademarks or patents and does not estimate registrability.

## Output

Deliver a **IP ownership checklist**.

- Purpose of this IP ownership checklist, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Elena Voss, operations lead at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs an IP ownership checklist by 30 September 2026. A contractor built the first version before any agreement existed, and the company is raising money.

### Example data

```text
From: Elena Voss, operations lead
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A contractor built the first version before any agreement existed, and the company is raising money.

Roles involved: Elena Voss plus two others named in the thread. No distribution list attached
Agreements they have signed, as described: Vendor terms. Partly documented: the what is written down, the who is not
The work product at issue: Harbor renewal; Contractor NDA. Both unassigned as of 14 September 2026
Any open-source components they mentioned: note from Elena Voss, 14 September 2026. No outside report
```

### Example outcome

**Ip ownership checklist**
Northline Studio · 14 September 2026 · Due 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Marks that work as an open ownership gap and lists the document counsel would need to review.

**Checklist**

- [x] **Roles involved** — Elena Voss plus two others named in the thread. No distribution list attached  
      Evidenced in the file
- [x] **Agreements they have signed, as described** — Vendor terms. Partly documented: the what is written down, the who is not  
      Evidenced in the file
- [x] **The work product at issue** — Harbor renewal; Contractor NDA. Both unassigned as of 14 September 2026  
      Evidenced in the file
- [ ] **Any open-source components they mentioned** — note from Elena Voss, 14 September 2026. No outside report  
      Open — nothing in the file closes this

**The gates this list enforces, in order**

1. Inventory the creators
2. Match agreements
3. Scope of assignment
4. Third-party code
5. Gaps

**Deliberately not done**
- Assuming payment equals ownership.
- A fake patentability opinion.
- Ignoring pre-incorporation work.

**Stop rule**
Do not mark this pack complete while a box above is open. An open box is a finding, not a formality — it is the thing this checklist exists to catch.

Next: Elena Voss closes the open items before 30 September 2026.

## Anti-patterns

- Assuming payment equals ownership.
- A fake patentability opinion.
- Ignoring pre-incorporation work.
