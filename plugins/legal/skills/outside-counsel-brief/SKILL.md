# Outside Counsel Brief

Brief outside counsel with the question, the facts, and the business constraint, so the meter starts on the right problem.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- brief outside counsel
- lawyer brief
- counsel instructions
- legal question memo

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship. Do not invent statutes, case names, or filing deadlines. Drafts are for qualified counsel in the relevant jurisdiction.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The decision needed
- The deadline
- Facts and documents
- The business constraint

## Workflow


### 1. Ask one question

A brief that asks counsel to 'look at this' will return a seminar. Write the decision the company must make.
### 2. Facts in order

Chronology, documents attached or listed, and unknowns. Do not hide a bad fact to get a comforting answer.
### 3. Business constraint

Budget, launch date, or relationship risk, labeled as context, not as an instruction to reach a preferred legal answer.
### 4. Prior advice

Note advice already received so counsel does not restart blindly.
### 5. Privilege care

Mark the draft as a request for legal advice if the user says that is the intent. Do not claim privilege as a magic label on ordinary business notes.
### 6. Desired deliverable

A short advice note, a markup, or a call. Say which.

## Output

Deliver a **outside counsel brief**.

- Purpose of this outside counsel brief, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.
