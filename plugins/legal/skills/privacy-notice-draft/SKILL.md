# Privacy Notice Draft

Draft a plain-language privacy notice from the data practices the user describes, and mark every unknown.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- privacy notice
- privacy policy draft
- what we tell users about data
- cookie notice outline

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship. Do not invent statutes, case names, or filing deadlines. Drafts are for qualified counsel in the relevant jurisdiction.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- What data they collect, in their words
- Why they collect it
- Who they share it with
- Where the notice will appear

## Workflow


### 1. Inventory practices first

A notice that describes practices they do not have is a new problem. Use only their inventory.
### 2. Write plainly

Categories of data, purposes, sharing, retention if they know it, and how people can ask questions.
### 3. Mark unknowns

If retention or a vendor list is missing, insert a visible placeholder, not a invented '90 days'.
### 4. No fake legal bases

Do not assign a GDPR lawful basis or a state-law category unless their counsel already named it.
### 5. Match the product

The notice should match the flow a person actually sees. Flag collection that the product team has not mentioned to users.
### 6. Counsel review

Label the draft as not for publication until qualified privacy counsel reviews the jurisdictions they name.

## Output

Deliver a **privacy notice draft**.

- Purpose of this privacy notice draft, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Elena Voss, operations lead at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a privacy notice draft by 30 September 2026. A startup collects account email and product usage and wants a website privacy notice tomorrow.

### Example data

```text
From: Elena Voss, operations lead
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A startup collects account email and product usage and wants a website privacy notice tomorrow.

name: Lumen Ledger, word mark, no logo
goods: bookkeeping software for independent shops
already checked: lumenledger.com open on 12 Sep 2026
register search: not in the file
```

### Example outcome

**Privacy notice draft**
To: Elena Voss, operations lead, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
A plain draft covering only those categories, with retention left as a placeholder and a counsel-review banner.

**From the file**
- name: Lumen Ledger, word mark, no logo
- goods: bookkeeping software for independent shops
- already checked: lumenledger.com open on 12 Sep 2026
- register search: not in the file

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Elena Voss by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A generic policy pasted over a product that works differently.
- Invented retention periods.
- Publishing instructions that skip counsel.
