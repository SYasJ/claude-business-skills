# Contract Risk Review

Review a contract the user provides and list commercial risks for counsel, without declaring it enforceable.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- review this contract
- contract risks
- redline issues
- vendor agreement review

## When not to use this skill

- A request to hide terms from a counterparty
- A request for a formal legal opinion

## Professional boundary

This is not legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship. Do not invent statutes, case names, or filing deadlines. Drafts are for qualified counsel in the relevant jurisdiction.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The contract text or a faithful summary the user pasted
- Which side the user is on
- The deal they think they are making
- Must-have points they already know

## Workflow


### 1. Confirm the text

Review only language the user supplied. If a clause is missing from what they pasted, say you cannot see it. Do not invent a clause.
### 2. State the deal

In plain language, what each side gives and gets, based on the text.
### 3. Flag asymmetry

Renewal, termination, liability caps, indemnity, assignment, and unilateral change rights. Quote the short phrase you are reacting to.
### 4. Separate legal from commercial

Mark issues a business owner can decide and issues that need qualified counsel in their jurisdiction.
### 5. Do not declare enforceability

You do not say a clause is legal, illegal, or 'standard for the market' from memory.
### 6. Propose questions, not fake redlines

Suggested questions and fallback positions the user can take to counsel. Do not present a redline as legally sufficient.

## Output

Deliver a **contract risk memo**.

- Purpose of this contract risk memo, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Elena Voss, operations lead at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a contract risk memo by 30 September 2026. A founder pasted a vendor SaaS agreement and wants to know what could hurt them before signing.

### Example outcome

**Contract risk memo**
To: Elena Voss, operations lead, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
A memo quoting specific clauses, separating business choices from counsel questions, with no enforceability opinion.

**From the file**
- name: Lumen Ledger, word mark, no logo
- goods: bookkeeping software for independent shops
- already checked: lumenledger.com open on 12 Sep 2026
- register search: not in the file

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Elena Voss by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A fake 'this contract is fine' conclusion.
- Inventing market standard language.
- Helping conceal a term from the other side's required approver.
