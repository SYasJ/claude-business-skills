# Renewal Preparation

Prepare an insurance renewal packet from the expiring facts and the changes the insured reported.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- insurance renewal
- renewal submission
- broker renewal
- market submission

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

This is not coverage advice and not a claim determination. Do not tell anyone they are covered. Organize facts for a licensed professional.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Expiring terms they have
- Changes in operations
- Losses they reported
- The deadline

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

List changes the insured actually reported.
### 2. Step 2

Include losses they documented. Do not omit a known loss.
### 3. Step 3

Mark unknown values as unknown.
### 4. Step 4

Note the questions underwriters asked last time if the user has them.
### 5. Step 5

Do not invent a premium.
### 6. Step 6

This packet does not bind coverage.

## Output

Deliver a **renewal prep**.

- Purpose of this renewal prep, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Priya Shah, controller at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a renewal prep by 30 September 2026. A renewal draft leaves off a recent claim to keep the story clean.

### Example data

```text
From: Priya Shah, controller
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A renewal draft leaves off a recent claim to keep the story clean.

Expiring terms they have: Coverage checklist, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
Changes in operations: requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved
Losses they reported: one file, dated 14 September 2026. No earlier version attached for comparison
The deadline: 30 September 2026
```

### Example outcome

**Renewal prep**
To: Priya Shah, controller, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Includes the claim and labels any premium figure as not yet quoted.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Expiring terms they have | Coverage checklist, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Needs confirmation |
| Changes in operations | requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved | Carried into the draft |
| Losses they reported | one file, dated 14 September 2026. No earlier version attached for comparison | Carried into the draft |
| The deadline | 30 September 2026 | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. List changes the insured actually reported**

**2. Include losses they documented. Do not omit a known loss**

**3. Mark unknown values as unknown**

**4. Note the questions underwriters asked last time if the user has them**

**5. Do not invent a premium**

**Deliberately not done**
- An omitted known loss.
- An invented premium.
- A claim that coverage is bound.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Priya Shah by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- An omitted known loss
