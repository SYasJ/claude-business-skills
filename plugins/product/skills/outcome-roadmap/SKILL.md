# Outcome Roadmap

Rebuild a feature roadmap into an outcome roadmap with bets, evidence, and kill criteria.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- outcome roadmap
- roadmap rewrite
- bets not features
- product strategy roadmap

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Product recommendations are hypotheses until evidence says otherwise. Label confidence. Do not ship dark patterns that hide cost or consent.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The current roadmap items
- The outcomes they are supposed to serve
- Evidence
- Capacity

## Workflow


### 1. Cluster

Group features under the outcome they claim to serve. Features with no outcome are parked.
### 2. Bet statement

For each outcome, the bet, the audience, and the evidence grade.
### 3. Sequence

Order bets by learning and constraint, not by who shouted.
### 4. Capacity

Cut bets until the team could actually run them. A roadmap over capacity is fiction.
### 5. Kill criteria

What would stop a bet. Write it on the roadmap.
### 6. Communication

A version stakeholders can read without decoding internal names.

## Output

Deliver a **outcome roadmap**.

- Purpose of this outcome roadmap, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Jonah Park, product manager at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs an outcome roadmap by 30 September 2026. A roadmap of 25 features is relabeled with four outcomes, but the team can staff one bet.

### Example data

```text
From: Jonah Park, product manager
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A roadmap of 25 features is relabeled with four outcomes, but the team can staff one bet.

interviews: 12, March to June 2026
decision: ship, hold, or cut
metric: not defined
kill line: not written
```

### Example outcome

**Outcome roadmap**
To: Jonah Park, product manager, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Keeps one staffed bet, parks the rest, and writes a kill criterion.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| interviews | 12, March to June 2026 | Needs confirmation |
| decision | ship, hold, or cut | Carried into the draft |
| metric | not defined | Carried into the draft |
| kill line | not written | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Cluster**  
Group features under the outcome they claim to serve. Features with no outcome are parked.

**2. Bet statement**  
For each outcome, the bet, the audience, and the evidence grade.

**3. Sequence**  
Order bets by learning and constraint, not by who shouted.

**4. Capacity**  
Cut bets until the team could actually run them. A roadmap over capacity is fiction.

**5. Kill criteria**  
What would stop a bet. Write it on the roadmap.

**Deliberately not done**
- Renaming features as outcomes without changing the plan.
- A roadmap that exceeds capacity.
- No kill criteria.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Jonah Park by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Renaming features as outcomes without changing the plan.
- A roadmap that exceeds capacity.
- No kill criteria.
