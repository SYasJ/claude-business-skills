# RICE Prioritization

Prioritize a short list with RICE or a simpler cut, and show the math instead of hiding behind it.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- RICE
- prioritize the roadmap
- score these ideas
- what should we build next

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Product recommendations are hypotheses until evidence says otherwise. Label confidence. Do not ship dark patterns that hide cost or consent.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The candidate list
- Evidence for reach and impact
- Effort estimates
- Constraints

## Workflow


### 1. Bound the list

Prioritize items that serve the current bet. Off-strategy items are parked, not scored into existence.
### 2. Score honestly

Reach, impact, confidence, and effort use the user's evidence. Low confidence stays low. Do not inflate confidence to win an argument.
### 3. Show the arithmetic

The score is visible. A black-box rank is not RICE.
### 4. Override in the open

If strategy or a commitment overrides the score, write the override. Do not fudge the inputs.
### 5. Cut

A ranked list with no cut is not a decision. Recommend now, next, and not now.
### 6. Revisit

The date the scores expire.

## Output

Deliver a **prioritization note**.

- Purpose of this prioritization note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Jonah Park, product manager at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a prioritization note by 30 September 2026. A stakeholder wants their idea scored 100 percent confidence so it sorts to the top.

### Example data

```text
From: Jonah Park, product manager
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A stakeholder wants their idea scored 100 percent confidence so it sorts to the top.

The candidate list: Activation checklist; Trial day-3 email; Usage limit warning
Evidence for reach and impact: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
Constraints: no extra headcount, and no result that is not in this file
```

### Example outcome

**Prioritization note**
To: Jonah Park, product manager, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Keeps confidence low, shows the math, and records any strategic override separately.

**From the file**
- The candidate list: Activation checklist; Trial day-3 email; Usage limit warning
- Evidence for reach and impact: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
- Constraints: no extra headcount, and no result that is not in this file

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Jonah Park by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Inflated confidence scores.
- A ranking with no cut.
- Fake precision to three decimals.

## Optional local tool

A stdlib script is bundled at `scripts/rice_score.py`. It scores a CSV of `item,reach,impact,confidence,effort` that you already filled in. It does not invent reach or confidence. Example: `python3 scripts/rice_score.py items.csv --json`.
