# Jobs To Be Done

Frame a job-to-be-done from a real situation, including the hire and the fire.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- jobs to be done
- JTBD
- job story
- what job is the user hiring

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Product recommendations are hypotheses until evidence says otherwise. Label confidence. Do not ship dark patterns that hide cost or consent.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- A recent incident the user described
- What the person was trying to achieve
- What they used instead
- Forces they mentioned

## Workflow


### 1. Situation

When and where the struggle showed up. No situation, no job story.
### 2. Motivation

The progress they wanted, in their words if available.
### 3. Hire

What they used, including spreadsheets and workarounds.
### 4. Fire

What was awkward about the old way, from evidence, not from your pitch.
### 5. Anxieties

What made a new approach feel risky, if they said so. Do not invent psychology.
### 6. Implication

What the product must be hired to do, and what it should not pretend to do.

## Output

Deliver a **job story**.

- Purpose of this job story, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Jonah Park, product manager at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a job story by 30 September 2026. A team writes the job as 'use our dashboard' after a customer described exporting to a spreadsheet.

### Example data

```text
From: Jonah Park, product manager
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A team writes the job as 'use our dashboard' after a customer described exporting to a spreadsheet.

interviews: 12, March to June 2026
decision: ship, hold, or cut
metric: not defined
kill line: not written
```

### Example outcome

**Job story**
To: Jonah Park, product manager, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
A job story about the export moment, with the spreadsheet as the current hire.

**From the file**
- interviews: 12, March to June 2026
- decision: ship, hold, or cut
- metric: not defined
- kill line: not written

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Jonah Park by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A job story that is a feature request in costume.
- Invented anxieties.
- Ignoring the workaround they already hired.
