# Sustainability Claim Review

Review a sustainability claim for substantiation before it is published.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- sustainability claim
- green claim
- ESG claim review
- net zero wording

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent emissions factors or certification status. Label estimates. This is not an assurance opinion.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The claim
- The evidence
- Where it will appear
- The reviewer

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Quote the claim.
### 2. Step 2

Match each factual part to evidence.
### 3. Step 3

Qualifiers such as net zero or carbon neutral need the basis they can show. If the basis is missing, cut the words.
### 4. Step 4

Avoid vague 'eco' language that implies a standard they do not meet.
### 5. Step 5

Send legal and advertising questions to counsel if they said the jurisdiction requires it.
### 6. Step 6

Do not help greenwash.

## Output

Deliver a **claim review**.

- Purpose of this claim review, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Devon Hale, reporting lead at Prairie Line Energy in Calgary, needs a claim review by 30 September 2026. Packaging says 'carbon neutral' and the only support is an intention.

### Example data

```text
From: Devon Hale, reporting lead
Organization: Prairie Line Energy, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Packaging says 'carbon neutral' and the only support is an intention.

The claim: the draft sentence is broader than the note
The evidence: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
The reviewer: Devon Hale. No second reviewer named
```

### Example outcome

**Claim review**
To: Devon Hale, reporting lead, Prairie Line Energy
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Removes the phrase until the basis exists.

**From the file**
- The claim: the draft sentence is broader than the note
- The evidence: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
- The reviewer: Devon Hale. No second reviewer named

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Devon Hale by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Greenwashing
- A standard implied but not held
