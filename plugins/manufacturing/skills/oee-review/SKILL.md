# OEE Review

Review overall equipment effectiveness only as far as their data supports, and pick one loss to attack.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- OEE
- equipment effectiveness
- downtime review
- loss tree

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Quality and safety procedures are drafts for the site's quality system. Do not bypass a hold, calibration, or safety step.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Availability, performance, and quality data they have
- The biggest loss they see
- The time window
- The owner

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Use only components they measured. Do not invent an OEE number.
### 2. Step 2

Define the time base they used.
### 3. Step 3

Pick the largest evidenced loss.
### 4. Step 4

Recommend one countermeasure with an owner.
### 5. Step 5

Do not turn OEE into a punishment metric in the write-up.
### 6. Step 6

Recheck after the countermeasure, not after a speech.

## Output

Deliver a **OEE review**.

- Purpose of this OEE review, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Gus Moretti, plant manager at Redline Parts in Nisku, needs an OEE review by 30 September 2026. A manager wants an OEE of 85 quoted to a customer, and downtime is not recorded.

### Example data

```text
From: Gus Moretti, plant manager
Organization: Redline Parts, Nisku
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A manager wants an OEE of 85 quoted to a customer, and downtime is not recorded.

line: line 2
lot: 26-0914
hold: open
count: the tally, not the order
```

### Example outcome

**Oee review**
To: Gus Moretti, plant manager, Redline Parts
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Refuses the number and starts a downtime record before any customer claim.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| line | line 2 | Needs confirmation |
| lot | 26-0914 | Carried into the draft |
| hold | open | Carried into the draft |
| count | the tally, not the order | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Use only components they measured. Do not invent an OEE number**

**2. Define the time base they used**

**3. Pick the largest evidenced loss**

**4. Recommend one countermeasure with an owner**

**5. Do not turn OEE into a punishment metric in the write-up**

**Deliberately not done**
- An invented OEE.
- Three losses attacked at once.
- A blame report.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Gus Moretti by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- An invented OEE
