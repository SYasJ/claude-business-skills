# Process FMEA Facilitation

Facilitate a process FMEA on a few high-risk steps, with actions for the failures that lack detection.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- FMEA
- process FMEA
- failure mode
- risk in the process

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Quality and safety procedures are drafts for the site's quality system. Do not bypass a hold, calibration, or safety step.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The process steps
- Failures they have seen
- Current controls
- Their scoring scale if any

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Limit the session to the steps that can hurt the customer or safety.
### 2. Step 2

Write failure modes as what goes wrong, not as one-word fears.
### 3. Step 3

Record current prevention and detection.
### 4. Step 4

Use their scale or a labeled simple scale. Do not pretend a score is precise.
### 5. Step 5

Actions go to high-severity gaps with weak detection.
### 6. Step 6

Do not lower a severity score to make the chart look calm.

## Output

Deliver a **FMEA notes**.

- Purpose of this FMEA notes, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Gus Moretti, plant manager at Redline Parts in Nisku, needs a FMEA notes by 30 September 2026. A team wants to mark a safety failure as low severity so the FMEA looks acceptable.

### Example data

```text
From: Gus Moretti, plant manager
Organization: Redline Parts, Nisku
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A team wants to mark a safety failure as low severity so the FMEA looks acceptable.

line: line 2
lot: 26-0914
hold: open
count: the tally, not the order
```

### Example outcome

**Fmea notes**
To: Gus Moretti, plant manager, Redline Parts
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Notes that keep the high severity and assign an action instead of editing the score.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| line | line 2 | Needs confirmation |
| lot | 26-0914 | Carried into the draft |
| hold | open | Carried into the draft |
| count | the tally, not the order | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Limit the session to the steps that can hurt the customer or safety**

**2. Write failure modes as what goes wrong, not as one-word fears**

**3. Record current prevention and detection**

**4. Use their scale or a labeled simple scale. Do not pretend a score is precise**

**5. Actions go to high-severity gaps with weak detection**

**Deliberately not done**
- Lowering severity to look green.
- A whole factory in one session.
- Scores with no action.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Gus Moretti by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Lowering severity to look green
- A whole factory in one session
- Scores with no action
