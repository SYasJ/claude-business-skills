# Scrap and Rework Review

Review scrap and rework so the largest cause gets an owner, and numbers tie to the floor.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- scrap review
- rework
- yield loss
- waste review

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Quality and safety procedures are drafts for the site's quality system. Do not bypass a hold, calibration, or safety step.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Scrap quantities and reasons
- Cost if known
- Where it is found
- The owner of the top reason

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Use their quantities. Do not invent a scrap rate.
### 2. Step 2

Separate scrap from rework. They need different actions.
### 3. Step 3

Rank causes. Attack the largest evidenced one.
### 4. Step 4

Check whether the reason codes are honest or a dumping code.
### 5. Step 5

Assign an owner.
### 6. Step 6

Tie the number to inventory or quality records if they can. A side spreadsheet that does not tie is a finding.

## Output

Deliver a **scrap review**.

- Purpose of this scrap review, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Gus Moretti, plant manager at Redline Parts in Nisku, needs a scrap review by 30 September 2026. Most scrap is coded 'other' and the team still wants a root cause.

### Example data

```text
From: Gus Moretti, plant manager
Organization: Redline Parts, Nisku
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Most scrap is coded 'other' and the team still wants a root cause.

Scrap quantities and reasons: Line 2. Partly documented: the what is written down, the who is not
Cost if known: CAD 27 direct. Overhead not in this line
Where it is found: Lot 26-0914, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
The owner of the top reason: Gus Moretti, plant manager
```

### Example outcome

**Scrap review**
To: Gus Moretti, plant manager, Redline Parts
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Makes the dumping code the first problem and assigns an owner to fix the codes.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scrap quantities and reasons | Line 2. Partly documented: the what is written down, the who is not | Needs confirmation |
| Cost if known | CAD 27 direct. Overhead not in this line | Carried into the draft |
| Where it is found | Lot 26-0914, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Carried into the draft |
| The owner of the top reason | Gus Moretti, plant manager | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Use their quantities. Do not invent a scrap rate**

**2. Separate scrap from rework. They need different actions**

**3. Rank causes. Attack the largest evidenced one**

**4. Check whether the reason codes are honest or a dumping code**

**5. Assign an owner**

**Deliberately not done**
- An invented yield.
- A dumping code ignored.
- No owner.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Gus Moretti by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- An invented yield
