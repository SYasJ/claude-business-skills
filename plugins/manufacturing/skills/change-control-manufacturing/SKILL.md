# Manufacturing Change Control

Review a manufacturing change for approval, risk, and the point it becomes effective.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- manufacturing change control
- process change
- engineering change
- ECO review

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Quality and safety procedures are drafts for the site's quality system. Do not bypass a hold, calibration, or safety step.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The change
- The risk they see
- Approvers
- The effective lot or date

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Describe the change and the reason.
### 2. Step 2

Identify what must be revalidated or reinspected, using their rules. Do not invent a regulatory filing.
### 3. Step 3

Name approvers. A change without the required approver is not effective.
### 4. Step 4

Set the effective lot or date so old and new do not mix unlabeled.
### 5. Step 5

Update the work instruction as part of done.
### 6. Step 6

Flag customer or regulatory notice as a question if they said it might apply.

## Output

Deliver a **change-control note**.

- Purpose of this change-control note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Gus Moretti, plant manager at Redline Parts in Nisku, needs a change-control note by 30 September 2026. A process tweak is already running and the change form is blank.

### Example data

```text
From: Gus Moretti, plant manager
Organization: Redline Parts, Nisku
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A process tweak is already running and the change form is blank.

The change: requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved
The risk they see: Line 2 is open. No score in the file
Approvers: Gus Moretti. They have not signed
The effective lot or date: 30 September 2026
```

### Example outcome

**Change-control note**
To: Gus Moretti, plant manager, Redline Parts
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Stops the unofficial tweak until approval and an effective point exist.

**From the file**
- The change: requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved
- The risk they see: Line 2 is open. No score in the file
- Approvers: Gus Moretti. They have not signed
- The effective lot or date: 30 September 2026

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Gus Moretti by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- An effective change with no approver
- Mixed lots with no label
- An invented filing
