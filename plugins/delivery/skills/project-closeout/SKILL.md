# Project Closeout

Close a project by confirming outcomes, handing over operations, and releasing the team.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- project closeout
- project closure
- handover to operations
- end a project

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Delivery plans are commitments only when owners and dates are real. Do not fabricate status to make a report look healthy.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The charter outcome
- What was delivered
- Open issues
- The operational owner

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Compare delivery to the charter outcome. Partial delivery is labeled partial.
### 2. Step 2

List open issues and who owns them after close.
### 3. Step 3

Hand over runbooks, access, and support paths. Do not share passwords in the closeout note.
### 4. Step 4

Release people and budget explicitly so the project does not linger.
### 5. Step 5

Record a few lessons that change a template.
### 6. Step 6

Thank-you notes are optional. A fake success statement is not.

## Output

Deliver a **closeout note**.

- Purpose of this closeout note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Owen Blake, delivery lead at Harbor Goods in Airdrie, needs a closeout note by 30 September 2026. A project is declared done while operations does not know how to support the new workflow.

### Example data

```text
From: Owen Blake, delivery lead
Organization: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A project is declared done while operations does not know how to support the new workflow.

milestone: the customer date
status: slipped
completed tasks: do not replace the slip
decision: needed
```

### Example outcome

**Closeout note**
To: Owen Blake, delivery lead, Harbor Goods
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Blocks full closure until the operational owner and open issues are named.

**From the file**
- milestone: the customer date
- status: slipped
- completed tasks: do not replace the slip
- decision: needed

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Owen Blake by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Closing with open issues and no owner
- A success claim that ignores the charter
- Passwords in the note
