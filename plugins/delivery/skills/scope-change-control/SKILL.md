# Scope Change Control

Write a scope change so the sponsor sees the trade before the team absorbs it silently.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- scope change
- change request
- gold plating
- can we add this

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Delivery plans are commitments only when owners and dates are real. Do not fabricate status to make a report look healthy.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The requested change
- The current baseline
- The impact on date, cost, or scope
- The decider

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Restate the request and who asked.
### 2. Step 2

Show the impact on the binding constraint.
### 3. Offer options

add time, add cost, or remove something else.
### 4. Step 4

Recommend one option. Silent absorption is not an option to hide.
### 5. Step 5

Name the decider. The delivery team does not accept scope by being polite.
### 6. Step 6

Record the decision so the baseline stays honest.

## Output

Deliver a **change request**.

- Purpose of this change request, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Owen Blake, delivery lead at Harbor Goods in Airdrie, needs a change request by 30 September 2026. A stakeholder adds a report and says it is tiny, with no estimate.

### Example data

```text
From: Owen Blake, delivery lead
Organization: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A stakeholder adds a report and says it is tiny, with no estimate.

The requested change: requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved
The current baseline: Milestone 3 handover, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
The impact on date, cost, or scope: CAD 18 direct. Overhead not in this line
The decider: Milestone 3 handover, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
```

### Example outcome

**Change request**
To: Owen Blake, delivery lead, Harbor Goods
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Refuses the silent add and offers a trade against the baseline.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The requested change | requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved | Needs confirmation |
| The current baseline | Milestone 3 handover, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Carried into the draft |
| The impact on date, cost, or scope | CAD 18 direct. Overhead not in this line | Carried into the draft |
| The decider | Milestone 3 handover, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Restate the request and who asked**

**2. Show the impact on the binding constraint**

**3. Offer options**  
add time, add cost, or remove something else.

**4. Recommend one option. Silent absorption is not an option to hide**

**5. Name the decider. The delivery team does not accept scope by being polite**

**Deliberately not done**
- Absorbing scope with no record.
- A change with no impact.
- The team acting as the decider by default.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Owen Blake by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Absorbing scope with no record
- A change with no impact
- The team acting as the decider by default
