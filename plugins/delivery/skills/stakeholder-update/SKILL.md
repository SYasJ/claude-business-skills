# Stakeholder Update

Draft a stakeholder update that tells each audience what changed for them and what you need.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- stakeholder update
- project update email
- sponsor update
- client status note

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Delivery plans are commitments only when owners and dates are real. Do not fabricate status to make a report look healthy.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- What changed
- Who is affected
- What you need from them
- What must not be overclaimed

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Segment the update if audiences need different actions.
### 2. Step 2

Lead with the change, not the backstory.
### 3. Step 3

State what you need and by when.
### 4. Step 4

Include a delay or a cut if one exists. Do not imply you are on track.
### 5. Step 5

Keep promises limited to decisions already made.
### 6. Step 6

Offer a path for questions.

## Output

Deliver a **stakeholder update**.

- Purpose of this stakeholder update, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Owen Blake, delivery lead at Harbor Goods in Airdrie, needs a stakeholder update by 30 September 2026. A client update draft says the launch is on track after scope was cut.

### Example data

```text
From: Owen Blake, delivery lead
Organization: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A client update draft says the launch is on track after scope was cut.

What changed: requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved
Who is affected: Owen Blake, delivery lead
What must not be overclaimed: the draft sentence is broader than the note
```

### Example outcome

**Stakeholder update**
To: Owen Blake, delivery lead, Harbor Goods
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
States the cut and asks the client to confirm the reduced scope.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What changed | requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved | Needs confirmation |
| Who is affected | Owen Blake, delivery lead | Carried into the draft |
| What must not be overclaimed | the draft sentence is broader than the note | Carried into the draft |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Segment the update if audiences need different actions**

**2. Lead with the change, not the backstory**

**3. State what you need and by when**

**4. Include a delay or a cut if one exists. Do not imply you are on track**

**5. Keep promises limited to decisions already made**

**Deliberately not done**
- A single vague update for audiences with different decisions.
- Hiding a delay.
- A promise not yet made.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Owen Blake by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A single vague update for audiences with different decisions
- Hiding a delay
- A promise not yet made
