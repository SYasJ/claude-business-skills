# Loss Prevention Incident Log

Write a factual loss prevention incident log from the events the user described, without accusations beyond what evidence supports.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- loss prevention
- LP incident
- shrink report
- theft incident log

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent inventory, prices, or reviews. Do not write deceptive promotions.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- What was observed
- Timestamps and locations
- What evidence exists
- What action was taken

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Record only what was observed, on camera, or documented. Do not infer intent from observation alone.
### 2. Step 2

Timestamps and locations must come from the user. Do not guess.
### 3. Evidence category

confirmed, on camera, alleged, or witness account. Label each.
### 4. Actions taken

what happened and who authorized it. Do not recommend an arrest the policy does not support.
### 5. Step 5

No names of persons not yet confirmed as employees or involved parties.
### 6. Step 6

This is a log, not a court finding.

## Output

Deliver a **LP incident log**.

- Purpose of this LP incident log, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Diane Cho, store lead at Harbor Goods in Airdrie, needs a LP incident log by 30 September 2026. A log says "the suspect stole the item" based on a single camera angle that does not show concealment.

### Example data

```text
From: Diane Cho, store lead
Organization: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A log says "the suspect stole the item" based on a single camera angle that does not show concealment.

store: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
price: shelf price
stock: the count
review: not invented
```

### Example outcome

**Lp incident log**
To: Diane Cho, store lead, Harbor Goods
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Says "item not seen at checkout; camera angle does not confirm concealment; LP notified.".

**From the file**
- store: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
- price: shelf price
- stock: the count
- review: not invented

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Diane Cho by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Inferring intent from observation
- An arrest recommendation without policy support
- Unnamed witnesses presented as confirmed
