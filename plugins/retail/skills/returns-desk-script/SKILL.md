# Returns Desk Script

Script a returns conversation that follows policy and does not accuse the shopper.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- returns script
- refund script
- retail returns
- desk conversation

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent inventory, prices, or reviews. Do not write deceptive promotions.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The policy
- What the colleague can see
- Authorized exceptions
- Tone

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

State the policy they supplied.
### 2. Step 2

Ask only for information the return requires.
### 3. Step 3

Do not accuse theft in the script. Route suspected fraud to their loss-prevention process.
### 4. Offer the next step

refund, exchange, or decline, as policy allows.
### 5. Step 5

Escalate when the shopper's case does not fit the script.
### 6. Step 6

Do not collect unrelated personal data.

## Output

Deliver a **returns script**.

- Purpose of this returns script, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Diane Cho, store lead at Harbor Goods in Airdrie, needs a returns script by 30 September 2026. A script tells associates to shame the shopper into keeping the item.

### Example data

```text
From: Diane Cho, store lead
Organization: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A script tells associates to shame the shopper into keeping the item.

store: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
price: shelf price
stock: the count
review: not invented
```

### Example outcome

**Returns script**
To: Diane Cho, store lead, Harbor Goods
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
States the policy calmly and escalates exceptions without shame.

**From the file**
- store: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
- price: shelf price
- stock: the count
- review: not invented

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Diane Cho by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.
