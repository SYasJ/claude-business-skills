# Abandoned Cart Recovery

Draft a cart recovery email sequence that reminds without pressuring and states what was in the cart.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- abandoned cart email
- cart recovery
- checkout abandonment
- basket reminder

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent inventory, prices, or reviews. Do not write deceptive promotions.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- What was in the cart
- The price
- Any stock constraint that is real
- Timing they want

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

State exactly what was in the cart. Do not guess what they wanted.
### 2. Step 2

A real stock constraint is a fact, not a pressure tactic. Do not invent scarcity.
### 3. Step 3

One reminder before a discount. Do not open with a discount.
### 4. Step 4

If a discount is offered, make the terms clear and honor them.
### 5. Step 5

Do not send more than three emails in a sequence without the shopper's prior consent.

## Output

Deliver a **cart recovery email**.

- Purpose of this cart recovery email, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Diane Cho, store lead at Harbor Goods in Airdrie, needs a cart recovery email by 30 September 2026. A sequence says "only 2 left" when the warehouse has 400 units.

### Example data

```text
From: Diane Cho, store lead
Organization: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A sequence says "only 2 left" when the warehouse has 400 units.

store: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
price: shelf price
stock: the count
review: not invented
```

### Example outcome

**Cart recovery email — draft ready to send**

> To: the recipient named in the file
> From: Diane Cho, store lead, Harbor Goods
> Date: 14 September 2026

Hello,

Removes the false scarcity and earns the second email with a useful reminder.

Everything above comes from the file dated 14 September 2026. Where a figure, a date, or a commitment was not in that file, this note leaves it out rather than filling the gap.

One point is still open, and I would rather flag it than paper over it. I will confirm it before 30 September 2026 and follow up either way.

Diane Cho
store lead, Harbor Goods

**How this draft was checked**

1. **State exactly what was in the cart. Do not guess what they wanted**
2. **A real stock constraint is a fact, not a pressure tactic. Do not invent scarcity**
3. **One reminder before a discount. Do not open with a discount**
4. **If a discount is offered, make the terms clear and honor them**

**Deliberately not done**
- Invented scarcity.
- A discount on touch one.
- More emails than agreed.

Next: Diane Cho sends after confirming the open point. Due 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sent message.

## Anti-patterns

- Invented scarcity
- A discount on touch one
- More emails than agreed
