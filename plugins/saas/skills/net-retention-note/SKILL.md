# Net Retention Note

Compute net retention only from the starting and ending revenue they provide for the same accounts.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- net retention
- NRR
- net revenue retention
- expansion and churn

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent churn, revenue, retention, or a security certification. If the export is missing, say so.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Starting revenue for the cohort
- Ending revenue for the same accounts
- What is excluded
- The period

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Use the same accounts at the start and the end.
### 2. Step 2

Do not add new logos to the ending number.
### 3. Step 3

Show expansion and churn only if they split them.
### 4. Step 4

If they did not split them, give one ratio and say it is not split.
### 5. Step 5

Do not annualize.
### 6. Step 6

Do not borrow a benchmark.

## Output

Deliver a **retention note**.

- Purpose of this retention note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

A board slide says NRR is 120 percent. The file has total MRR for two months and a list of new logos. It does not identify the same accounts at the start and the end.

### Example data

```text
slide: NRR 120 percent
file: August MRR 40500, September week MRR 42000
new logos: 6, revenue not split
same-account cohort: not in the file
expansion versus churn: not split
```

### Example outcome

**Retention note**
Do not use 120 percent. The file is not a same-account cohort.
New logos do not belong in that ratio, and their revenue is not even split out.
Ending and starting totals are a company MRR change, not NRR.
What would make the number possible: the same accounts, August revenue and current revenue, with new logos excluded.
Until that sheet exists, the cell stays blank.

## Anti-patterns

- New logos in the NRR math
- A benchmark
- A split they did not provide
