# Churn Save Plan

Plan a save offer from the cancel reasons in the export and the offer they can honor.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- churn save
- cancel flow
- save offer
- why are they leaving

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent churn, revenue, retention, or a security certification. If the export is missing, say so.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Cancel reasons
- Counts
- The offer they can honor
- Who approves a credit

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Rank reasons by their counts.
### 2. Step 2

Match an offer only to a reason it can fix.
### 3. Step 3

A price save does not fix a missing feature.
### 4. Step 4

Use only credits they authorized.
### 5. Step 5

Do not invent a save rate.
### 6. Step 6

Name the approver.

## Output

Deliver a **save plan**.

- Purpose of this save plan, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Forty cancels in August. Twenty-two said the export they need does not exist. Ten said price. Eight gave no reason. A draft offers 20 percent off to all forty. Jonah can approve a 10 percent credit, not 20.

### Example data

```text
cancels: 40, August 2026
missing export: 22
price: 10
no reason: 8
credit he can approve: 10 percent, one month
20 percent draft: not approved
```

### Example outcome

**Save plan**
Do not discount the 22. A cheaper plan does not create the missing export.
Price reason, 10 accounts: a 10 percent credit for one month is the offer he can honor. Not 20.
No reason, 8: no offer. Ask, or leave them.
No save rate is claimed. None was measured.
Approver for the credit: Jonah.

## Anti-patterns

- One offer for every reason
- An unauthorized credit
- A fake save rate
