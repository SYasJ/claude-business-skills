# RFI Writer

Write a request for information that states the conflict, the location, and the date the answer is needed.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- RFI
- request for information
- drawing conflict
- design clarification

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Site safety and contract administration follow the contract and the site rules. Do not tell anyone to skip a safety control. Do not invent quantities.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The conflict
- The drawing or spec location
- The date needed
- The proposed clarification if any

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Describe the conflict with locations they gave.
### 2. Step 2

Ask one question.
### 3. Step 3

State the date the answer is needed and why.
### 4. Step 4

A proposed clarification is labeled as a proposal, not as approval.
### 5. Step 5

Attach references they have. Do not invent a detail.
### 6. Step 6

Track the RFI so work does not proceed on a guess unless they accept that risk in writing.

## Output

Deliver a **RFI**.

- Purpose of this RFI, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Tom Reilly, site lead at Birch Siteworks in Cochrane, needs a RFI by 30 September 2026. An RFI asks the designer to 'see the attached and advise' with no question.

### Example data

```text
From: Tom Reilly, site lead
Organization: Birch Siteworks, Cochrane
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

An RFI asks the designer to 'see the attached and advise' with no question.

The conflict: Birch site, Cochrane, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
The drawing or spec location: two deals cited from memory. Neither has a written loss reason
The date needed: 30 September 2026
The proposed clarification if any: Birch site, Cochrane, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
```

### Example outcome

**Rfi**
To: Tom Reilly, site lead, Birch Siteworks
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
An RFI with one located question, a need-by date, and no invented detail.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The conflict | Birch site, Cochrane, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Needs confirmation |
| The drawing or spec location | two deals cited from memory. Neither has a written loss reason | Carried into the draft |
| The date needed | 30 September 2026 | Carried into the draft |
| The proposed clarification if any | Birch site, Cochrane, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Describe the conflict with locations they gave**

**2. Ask one question**

**3. State the date the answer is needed and why**

**4. A proposed clarification is labeled as a proposal, not as approval**

**5. Attach references they have. Do not invent a detail**

**Deliberately not done**
- Three questions in one RFI.
- An invented detail.
- Work proceeding on a silent guess.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Tom Reilly by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns
