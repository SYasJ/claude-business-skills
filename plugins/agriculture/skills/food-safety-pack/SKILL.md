# Food Safety Pack

Assemble a food-safety document pack from the practices they already run, for their auditor or buyer.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- food safety pack
- farm audit pack
- GAP pack
- buyer food safety

## When not to use this skill

- Pathogen production
- Toxin instructions

## Professional boundary

Farm plans are operational, not agronomic prescriptions for hazardous materials. Do not provide instructions for synthesizing pesticides, toxins, or pathogens. A local agronomist or veterinarian should confirm field decisions.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Practices they documented
- The buyer's checklist
- Known gaps
- The owner

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Map their documents to the checklist.
### 2. Step 2

Missing items stay missing.
### 3. Step 3

Do not write a procedure for a practice they do not perform and present it as current.
### 4. Step 4

Escalate hazards they named to the person responsible. Do not provide pathogen growth or toxin instructions.
### 5. Step 5

Name the owner of each gap.
### 6. Step 6

This pack is not a certification.

## Output

Deliver a **food-safety pack**.

- Purpose of this food-safety pack, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Ruth McKay, operator at Two Hills Farm in Olds, needs a food-safety pack by 30 September 2026. A pack includes a handwashing SOP the farm does not use, to satisfy a checklist.

### Example data

```text
From: Ruth McKay, operator
Organization: Two Hills Farm, Olds
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A pack includes a handwashing SOP the farm does not use, to satisfy a checklist.

Practices they documented: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
The buyer's checklist: Cedar Clinic
Known gaps: Cedar Clinic is missing a source
The owner: Ruth McKay, operator
```

### Example outcome

**Food-safety pack**
To: Ruth McKay, operator, Two Hills Farm
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Marks the SOP as not in place and assigns an owner if they choose to adopt it.

**From the file**
- Practices they documented: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
- The buyer's checklist: Cedar Clinic
- Known gaps: Cedar Clinic is missing a source
- The owner: Ruth McKay, operator

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Ruth McKay by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A fake current procedure
- Pathogen or toxin instructions
- A certification claim
