# War Room Brief

Stand up a short-lived response when a serious business issue needs daily focus, without turning panic into a permanent process.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- war room
- crisis brief
- we have a serious issue
- daily response plan

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Strategy work recommends a direction. It does not guarantee market outcomes.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- What happened, in facts
- Who is affected
- Decisions needed in the next 48 hours
- Who is in charge

## Workflow


### 1. State the incident

Facts, time, impact, and what is still unknown. No blame paragraph at the top.
### 2. Set the objective

What 'stable' means in the next 48 hours. A war room without an objective becomes a standing meeting.
### 3. Assign roles

One owner, a decision maker, a communications owner, and a note taker. Everyone else is on call, not in the room.
### 4. List decisions

Only decisions that cannot wait. Park strategy redesign.
### 5. Plan communications

Who needs to know what, internally and externally, and what must be approved before it is said. Do not draft deceptive reassurance.
### 6. Set an end

A review point when the war room dissolves back into normal cadence.

## Output

Deliver a **war-room brief**.

- Purpose of this war-room brief, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a war-room brief by 30 September 2026. A key supplier missed a shipment and three major customers will stock out within a week.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A key supplier missed a shipment and three major customers will stock out within a week.

Who is affected: Mara Chen, founder
Decisions needed in the next 48 hours: A key supplier missed a shipment and three major customers will stock out within a week
Who is in charge: Mara Chen, founder
```

### Example outcome

**War-room brief**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
A 48-hour brief with an owner, the decisions required today, a truthful customer message draft, and an end condition.

**From the file**
- Who is affected: Mara Chen, founder
- Decisions needed in the next 48 hours: A key supplier missed a shipment and three major customers will stock out within a week
- Who is in charge: Mara Chen, founder

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Inviting the whole company into the war room.
- Promising customers facts you do not have.
- Leaving the war room running for months.
