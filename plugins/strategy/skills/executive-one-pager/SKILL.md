# Executive One-Pager

Compress a complex issue into a single page a busy executive can act on.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- one-pager
- exec summary
- brief the CEO
- single page brief

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Strategy work recommends a direction. It does not guarantee market outcomes.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The audience and the decision they can make
- The source material or the user's facts
- The recommendation if there is one
- What must not be cut

## Workflow


### 1. Identify the reader

Write for the person who will decide, not for every stakeholder who wants a mention.
### 2. Put the point first

The top of the page states the situation, the recommendation, and the ask.
### 3. Support with three facts

Choose the three facts that would change the decision if they were wrong. Move the rest out.
### 4. Name the tradeoff

What the recommendation costs or risks. A one-pager with no tradeoff is an advertisement.
### 5. End with the action

Owner, date, and what 'done' means.
### 6. Cut jargon

If a term is internal, translate it. The reader should not need a glossary.

## Output

Deliver a **executive one-pager**.

- Purpose of this executive one-pager, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs an executive one-pager by 30 September 2026. A general manager needs the CEO to approve a price test and currently has a 14-page appendix.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A general manager needs the CEO to approve a price test and currently has a 14-page appendix.

decision: the one in the ask
options: two, named
evidence: the file only
unowned idea: parked
```

### Example outcome

**Executive one-pager**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
A one-page brief with the test, the risk, three facts, and a yes-or-no ask.

**From the file**
- decision: the one in the ask
- options: two, named
- evidence: the file only
- unowned idea: parked

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Shrinking a long memo by reducing the font.
- Including every stakeholder's paragraph.
- Hiding the ask in the last line.
