# Portfolio Prioritization

Rank a set of initiatives by constraint, not by who argued last, and make the cut visible.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- prioritize initiatives
- what should we stop
- portfolio review
- too many projects

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Strategy work recommends a direction. It does not guarantee market outcomes.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The list of initiatives
- The scarce resource: people, cash, or attention
- Strategy bets
- Which items are truly mandatory

## Workflow


### 1. Name the constraint

Prioritize against the scarce resource. If everything is priority one, nothing is.
### 2. Separate mandatory from chosen

Regulatory, contractual, or safety work the user confirms as mandatory sits above discretionary bets.
### 3. Score simply

Use impact on the stated bet, cost in the scarce resource, and time to evidence. Do not use a fake-precise 14-factor model.
### 4. Make the cut

Recommend a stop, pause, and continue list. A ranking with no cut is not prioritization.
### 5. Show the losers

Write why attractive work is waiting. Silent cuts become shadow projects.
### 6. Set a reopen date

The portfolio is reviewed on a date, not whenever someone escalates.

## Output

Deliver a **prioritized portfolio**.

- Purpose of this prioritized portfolio, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a prioritized portfolio by 30 September 2026. A leadership team has 22 active initiatives and 9 managers, and wants a portfolio cut before annual planning.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A leadership team has 22 active initiatives and 9 managers, and wants a portfolio cut before annual planning.

decision: the one in the ask
options: two, named
evidence: the file only
unowned idea: parked
```

### Example outcome

**Prioritized portfolio**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
A continue, pause, and stop list tied to manager capacity, with the reason each stopped item is waiting.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| decision | the one in the ask | Needs confirmation |
| options | two, named | Carried into the draft |
| evidence | the file only | Carried into the draft |
| unowned idea | parked | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Name the constraint**  
Prioritize against the scarce resource. If everything is priority one, nothing is.

**2. Separate mandatory from chosen**  
Regulatory, contractual, or safety work the user confirms as mandatory sits above discretionary bets.

**3. Score simply**  
Use impact on the stated bet, cost in the scarce resource, and time to evidence. Do not use a fake-precise 14-factor model.

**4. Make the cut**  
Recommend a stop, pause, and continue list. A ranking with no cut is not prioritization.

**5. Show the losers**  
Write why attractive work is waiting. Silent cuts become shadow projects.

**Deliberately not done**
- Prioritizing by executive volume.
- Keeping every project and 'focusing' in the narrative only.
- A weighted model nobody can explain.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Prioritizing by executive volume.
- Keeping every project and 'focusing' in the narrative only.
- A weighted model nobody can explain.
