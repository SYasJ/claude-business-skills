# Decision Log

Record an important decision so a later reader can see the choice, the alternatives, and what would reopen it.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- decision log
- document this decision
- why did we choose
- decision record
- ADR for the business

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Strategy work recommends a direction. It does not guarantee market outcomes.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The decision in one sentence
- Alternatives considered
- Facts used
- Who decided and when

## Workflow


### 1. State the decision

One sentence, past or present tense, with the date and the decider. No preamble.
### 2. Record alternatives

At least one real alternative that was rejected, and why. If none was considered, say that plainly.
### 3. Cite facts

List only evidence the user provided. Do not backfill a rationale that sounds smarter than the actual one.
### 4. Name the reopen condition

What new fact would justify revisiting the decision. Decisions without reopen conditions become dogma.
### 5. Note consequences

Who must change what by when because of this decision.
### 6. File it

Suggest a location and a title the team can find later. Do not create a new bureaucracy around the log.

## Output

Deliver a **decision record**.

- Purpose of this decision record, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a decision record by 30 September 2026. A leadership team chose to pause a second product line after a renewal slipped, and they want the reason written down.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A leadership team chose to pause a second product line after a renewal slipped, and they want the reason written down.

decision: the one in the ask
options: two, named
evidence: the file only
unowned idea: parked
```

### Example outcome

**Decision record**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Drove it, and the condition that would reopen it.

**From the file**
- decision: the one in the ask
- options: two, named
- evidence: the file only
- unowned idea: parked

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Rewriting history to make a messy decision look inevitable.
- Logging every tiny choice.
- Omitting the rejected alternative.
