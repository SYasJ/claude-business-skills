# Change Leadership

Plan how a specific change will be adopted, including who loses something and how you will support them.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- change management
- rollout to the org
- people side of change
- adoption plan

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Strategy work recommends a direction. It does not guarantee market outcomes.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The change in concrete terms
- Who must work differently
- What they lose or must learn
- Sponsor and timing

## Workflow


### 1. Describe the change in behavior

What will a specific person do differently on a Tuesday. If you cannot say, the change is not defined.
### 2. Name losses

Status, skill, convenience, or headcount effects the user has acknowledged. Do not pretend a hard change is only upside.
### 3. Pick sponsors

A sponsor who will not repeat the message is not a sponsor. Recommend a cadence of visible reinforcement.
### 4. Support the middle

Managers need a script, a FAQ grounded in decisions already made, and a way to raise exceptions.
### 5. Measure adoption

Choose one or two observable behaviors, not a survey score alone.
### 6. Plan resistance

Treat resistance as information. Design a channel for it. Do not draft ways to punish questions.

## Output

Deliver a **change adoption plan**.

- Purpose of this change adoption plan, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a change adoption plan by 30 September 2026. Finance is moving the company from monthly spreadsheets to a shared close calendar and managers are ignoring it.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Finance is moving the company from monthly spreadsheets to a shared close calendar and managers are ignoring it.

The change in concrete terms: requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved
Who must work differently: Mara Chen, founder
What they lose or must learn: Finance is moving the company from monthly spreadsheets to a shared close calendar and managers are ignoring it
```

### Example outcome

**Change adoption plan**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Names Tuesday behaviors, manager support, the loss of local flexibility, and one observable adoption metric.

**From the file**
- The change in concrete terms: requested 14 September 2026. Not yet approved
- Who must work differently: Mara Chen, founder
- What they lose or must learn: Finance is moving the company from monthly spreadsheets to a shared close calendar and managers are ignoring it

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A change plan that is only a slide about urgency.
- Hiding job impact.
- Measuring adoption with a single enthusiasm survey.
