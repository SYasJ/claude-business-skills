# Culture Diagnostic

Describe how the culture actually behaves, using evidence, and name one habit worth changing.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- culture problem
- how we work
- culture diagnostic
- values versus behavior

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Strategy work recommends a direction. It does not guarantee market outcomes.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Incidents or examples the user witnessed
- Stated values, if any
- What the user wants culture to help the business do
- Limits on what they are willing to change

## Workflow


### 1. Prefer stories to adjectives

Collect specific moments. 'We are innovative' is not evidence.
### 2. Compare stated and lived

Where values and promotions, meetings, or incidents disagree, write the gap carefully and without gossip.
### 3. Tie culture to work

Which business result is harder because of the current habit.
### 4. Choose one habit

Recommend one behavior to change in the next quarter, with a manager ritual that reinforces it. Do not propose a rebrand of the values poster.
### 5. Watch power

Note whether the habit is rewarded in who gets promoted or excused. Use only examples the user gave.
### 6. Avoid armchair psychology

Do not diagnose individuals. Describe systems and norms.

## Output

Deliver a **culture diagnostic**.

- Purpose of this culture diagnostic, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a culture diagnostic by 30 September 2026. A founder says the culture is 'like a family' but missed commitments have no consequence.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A founder says the culture is 'like a family' but missed commitments have no consequence.

decision: the one in the ask
options: two, named
evidence: the file only
unowned idea: parked
```

### Example outcome

**Culture diagnostic**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Uses the user's incidents, names the accountability gap, and proposes one ritual rather than a new values poster.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| decision | the one in the ask | Needs confirmation |
| options | two, named | Carried into the draft |
| evidence | the file only | Carried into the draft |
| unowned idea | parked | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Prefer stories to adjectives**  
Collect specific moments. 'We are innovative' is not evidence.

**2. Compare stated and lived**  
Where values and promotions, meetings, or incidents disagree, write the gap carefully and without gossip.

**3. Tie culture to work**  
Which business result is harder because of the current habit.

**4. Choose one habit**  
Recommend one behavior to change in the next quarter, with a manager ritual that reinforces it. Do not propose a rebrand of the values poster.

**5. Watch power**  
Note whether the habit is rewarded in who gets promoted or excused. Use only examples the user gave.

**Deliberately not done**
- A new values list with no behavior change.
- Blaming 'culture' for a single underperforming person.
- Inventing survey results.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A new values list with no behavior change.
- Blaming 'culture' for a single underperforming person.
- Inventing survey results.
