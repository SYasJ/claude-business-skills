# Scenario Planning

Build a small set of contrasting futures and the early signs that tell you which one you are in.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- scenario planning
- what if
- upside and downside cases
- strategic scenarios

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Strategy work recommends a direction. It does not guarantee market outcomes.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The decision the scenarios inform
- Two or three uncertainties that actually matter
- Time horizon
- Facts and constraints already known

## Workflow


### 1. Pick uncertainties

Choose two uncertainties the user believes could break the plan. Do not brainstorm twenty.
### 2. Build three or four futures

A base case, a downside, and an upside are enough. Name each future so people can talk about it.
### 3. Stay internally consistent

A downside case cannot also assume the best sales cycle and the cheapest hiring market unless the user says so.
### 4. Find signposts

For each scenario, name two observable signs that would tell you it is unfolding. Signs must be measurable in the user's world.
### 5. Pre-commit moves

For the downside, write the move you would make if the signpost hits, including what you would stop.
### 6. Do not pretend precision

Scenarios are stories with logic, not forecasts. Label them as such.

## Output

Deliver a **scenario set with signposts**.

- Purpose of this scenario set with signposts, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a scenario set with signposts by 30 September 2026. A services firm wants to know how to plan hiring if a key public-sector contract is delayed by two quarters.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A services firm wants to know how to plan hiring if a key public-sector contract is delayed by two quarters.

The decision the scenarios inform: A services firm wants to know how to plan hiring if a key public-sector contract is delayed by two quarters
Time horizon: 13 weeks
Facts and constraints already known: no extra headcount, and no result that is not in this file
```

### Example outcome

**Scenario set with signposts**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Three named scenarios, the signposts for each, and a hiring move tied to the delay signpost rather than to hope.

**From the file**
- The decision the scenarios inform: A services firm wants to know how to plan hiring if a key public-sector contract is delayed by two quarters
- Time horizon: 13 weeks
- Facts and constraints already known: no extra headcount, and no result that is not in this file

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A single forecast with a confidence interval dressed up as scenarios.
- Scenarios that differ only by a percentage.
- Inventing macro statistics to decorate the story.
