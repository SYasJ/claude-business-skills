# Corporate Narrative

Write the company story employees and customers can repeat without sliding into hype.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- company narrative
- our story
- why we exist
- elevator pitch for the company
- narrative memo

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Strategy work recommends a direction. It does not guarantee market outcomes.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Who the company serves
- The problem in the customer's language
- Proof points the user can stand behind
- What the company refuses to claim

## Workflow


### 1. Start with the customer

The first lines describe the customer's tension, not the founding myth.
### 2. State the change

What is different because the company exists. One change, not a list of values.
### 3. Add proof

Two proof points the user supplied. If proof is thin, write a humbler story rather than borrowing fake logos.
### 4. Write three lengths

A sentence, a paragraph, and a half page. They must agree with each other.
### 5. Remove hype

Delete 'revolutionary,' 'unique,' and unearned category claims. Specific beats grand.
### 6. Note the audience

Offer a variant for employees if the user needs one, focused on how daily work connects to the change.

## Output

Deliver a **corporate narrative**.

- Purpose of this corporate narrative, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Mara Chen, founder at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a corporate narrative by 30 September 2026. A team has five conflicting About pages and wants one narrative before a launch.

### Example data

```text
From: Mara Chen, founder
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A team has five conflicting About pages and wants one narrative before a launch.

Who the company serves: Mara Chen, founder
The problem in the customer's language: Kite Freight
Proof points the user can stand behind: one customer email, 14 September 2026, no attachment beyond that
What the company refuses to claim: the draft sentence is broader than the note
```

### Example outcome

**Corporate narrative**
To: Mara Chen, founder, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Share one customer change and only the proof the user provided.

**From the file**
- Who the company serves: Mara Chen, founder
- The problem in the customer's language: Kite Freight
- Proof points the user can stand behind: one customer email, 14 September 2026, no attachment beyond that
- What the company refuses to claim: the draft sentence is broader than the note

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Mara Chen by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A founding story that never mentions the customer.
- Claims of market leadership without evidence.
- A different story for every channel.
