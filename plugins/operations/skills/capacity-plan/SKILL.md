# Capacity Plan

Plan capacity from demand and real throughput, and show the constraint before hiring or buying.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- capacity plan
- do we have capacity
- throughput plan
- staffing versus demand

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Operating procedures should be usable by the team that will run them. Do not add surveillance of employees beyond what the user explicitly asks to document as policy.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Demand they expect
- Current throughput
- The constraint
- Time horizon

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Define the unit of work and the horizon.
### 2. Step 2

Use their throughput, not an industry benchmark.
### 3. Name the constraint

people, a tool, a supplier, or a policy.
### 4. Step 4

Show the gap between demand and throughput in their units.
### 5. Options

smooth demand, remove a wait, or add capacity. Adding capacity is not the default if a wait is the constraint.
### 6. Step 6

State what would make the plan wrong.

## Output

Deliver a **capacity plan**.

- Purpose of this capacity plan, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Diane Cho, operations manager at Harbor Goods in Airdrie, needs a capacity plan by 30 September 2026. A team wants three hires because the queue is long, and approvals sit for two days.

### Example data

```text
From: Diane Cho, operations manager
Organization: Harbor Goods, Airdrie
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A team wants three hires because the queue is long, and approvals sit for two days.

shift: two people
SOP: one page, 2 Mar 2026
exception: not logged
queue: the items in the ask
```

### Example outcome

**Capacity plan**
To: Diane Cho, operations manager, Harbor Goods
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Tests the approval wait before treating hires as the answer.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| shift | two people | Needs confirmation |
| SOP | one page, 2 Mar 2026 | Carried into the draft |
| exception | not logged | Carried into the draft |
| queue | the items in the ask | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Define the unit of work and the horizon**

**2. Use their throughput, not an industry benchmark**

**3. Name the constraint**  
people, a tool, a supplier, or a policy.

**4. Show the gap between demand and throughput in their units**

**5. Options**  
smooth demand, remove a wait, or add capacity. Adding capacity is not the default if a wait is the constraint.

**Deliberately not done**
- An invented benchmark.
- Hiring as the only option.
- A plan with no unit of work.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Diane Cho by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- An invented benchmark
- Hiring as the only option
- A plan with no unit of work
