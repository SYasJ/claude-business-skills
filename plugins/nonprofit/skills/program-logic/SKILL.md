# Program Logic

Draft a program logic model that shows inputs, activities, and outcomes without pretending impact is proven.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- logic model
- theory of change
- program logic
- outcome model

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent impact metrics or donor intent. Fundraising copy must be accurate and free of pressure tactics that misstate the need.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Inputs they have
- Activities
- Intended outcomes
- Evidence so far

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Start from activities they actually run.
### 2. Step 2

Write outcomes as changes, and label them intended if unmeasured.
### 3. Step 3

Show the assumption between activity and outcome.
### 4. Step 4

Do not draw an impact arrow they have not tested.
### 5. Step 5

Note missing data.
### 6. Step 6

Keep the model to one program.

## Output

Deliver a **logic model**.

- Purpose of this logic model, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Amira Hassan, program director at Open Kitchen Society in Calgary, needs a logic model by 30 September 2026. A logic model says the workshop causes employment, and nobody tracked jobs.

### Example data

```text
From: Amira Hassan, program director
Organization: Open Kitchen Society, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A logic model says the workshop causes employment, and nobody tracked jobs.

program: the one they run
measured outcome: no
ask: one
story: not invented
```

### Example outcome

**Logic model**
To: Amira Hassan, program director, Open Kitchen Society
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Labels employment as intended and names the missing measure.

**From the file**
- program: the one they run
- measured outcome: no
- ask: one
- story: not invented

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Amira Hassan by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A proven-impact claim with no measure
- Activities that are not real
- A model of five programs at once
