# Case Statement

Write a case for support from real need, real program facts, and a specific ask.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- case for support
- fundraising narrative
- case statement
- donor narrative

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent impact metrics or donor intent. Fundraising copy must be accurate and free of pressure tactics that misstate the need.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The need they can evidence
- The program
- The ask
- What donors must not be told

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Describe the need with evidence they have.
### 2. Step 2

Explain what the program actually does.
### 3. Step 3

Separate outputs from outcomes.
### 4. Step 4

Make one ask.
### 5. Step 5

Do not invent a beneficiary story or a success rate.
### 6. Step 6

Avoid pressure tactics that misstate urgency.

## Output

Deliver a **case statement**.

- Purpose of this case statement, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Amira Hassan, program director at Open Kitchen Society in Calgary, needs a case statement by 30 September 2026. A case says 90 percent of participants succeed, and no outcome is tracked.

### Example data

```text
From: Amira Hassan, program director
Organization: Open Kitchen Society, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A case says 90 percent of participants succeed, and no outcome is tracked.

program: the one they run
measured outcome: no
ask: one
story: not invented
```

### Example outcome

**Case statement**
To: Amira Hassan, program director, Open Kitchen Society
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Removes the percentage and describes the program without a fake rate.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| program | the one they run | Needs confirmation |
| measured outcome | no | Carried into the draft |
| ask | one | Carried into the draft |
| story | not invented | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Describe the need with evidence they have**

**2. Explain what the program actually does**

**3. Separate outputs from outcomes**

**4. Make one ask**

**5. Do not invent a beneficiary story or a success rate**

**Deliberately not done**
- Invented beneficiary stories.
- A fake urgency.
- Outcomes they have not measured.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Amira Hassan by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Invented beneficiary stories
- A fake urgency
- Outcomes they have not measured
