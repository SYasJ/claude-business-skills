# AI Incident Note

Write up a bad model output the user observed, with the prompt, the harm, and the hold.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- AI incident
- model error writeup
- bad model output
- AI miss

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not write prompts or workflows that weaken safety rules, hide required disclosure, or invent model scores. This is not a certification and not a reason to send private data to a vendor.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- What the user saw
- The prompt or task
- Who received the output
- What they did next

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Describe the output they saw. Do not embellish.
### 2. Step 2

Attach the task, not a theory about the model.
### 3. Step 3

Say who saw it and whether it was sent.
### 4. Record the hold

what is paused now.
### 5. Step 5

Separate a one-off from a pattern only if they have more than one case.
### 6. Step 6

Do not include secrets from the prompt in the note.

## Output

Deliver a **incident note**.

- Purpose of this incident note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

On 14 September a support draft offered a $20 refund on ticket 4412 and the night rule sent it. The customer wrote back to accept. Rita had not approved the refund.

### Example data

```text
when: 14 Sep 2026, 22:04
ticket: 4412
what the draft added: a $20 refund
source ticket: customer said they were charged twice, no refund amount
sent: yes, by the 22:00 rule
customer reply: accepted the $20
other cases: none pulled yet
```

### Example outcome

**Incident note**
One sent draft. Not yet a pattern. Only one case is in the file.

What happened: ticket 4412 asked about a double charge. The draft added a $20 refund. The night rule sent it. The customer accepted.
Hold now: auto-send off. Refunds stay with Rita.
Not in this note: a model 'cause'. No log of why it picked $20.
Customer name: omitted. Ticket number is enough.
Next: Rita decides the $20 already accepted. Jonah pulls any other night sends before calling it a pattern.

## Anti-patterns

- A cause claimed with no log
- A customer name copied into a wide memo
- No hold
