# Agent Task Card

Bound an agent task: the inputs, the tools, the stop rules, and the human owner.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- agent task
- what may the agent do
- agent boundary
- tool use card

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not write prompts or workflows that weaken safety rules, hide required disclosure, or invent model scores. This is not a certification and not a reason to send private data to a vendor.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The task
- Tools they want it to call
- Actions that need a person
- The owner

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Write the task so a stranger could tell when it is done.
### 2. Step 2

List tools by name. No implied tools.
### 3. Step 3

Put money movement, sending, and deletes behind a person.
### 4. Step 4

State the stop rule when a fact is missing.
### 5. Step 5

Name the owner of a bad run.
### 6. Step 6

Do not grant a tool the user did not name.

## Output

Deliver a **task card**.

- Purpose of this task card, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

A spec says the support agent may read the ticket, email the customer, and issue a credit under $30. Jonah wants a card that a person can enforce.

### Example data

```text
task: turn one ticket into a reply draft
tools named: help desk read, model draft
tools in the spec that he will not grant: send email, issue credit
stop if: the ticket has no order id, or a card number is present
owner of a bad run: Jonah Park
done looks like: a draft Rita can accept or reject
```

### Example outcome

**Task card — support-reply-draft**
Done: a draft is waiting for Rita. Not done: an email sent, a credit posted.

Tools: read the ticket, write a draft. No other tool.
Stop: no order id, or a card number is still in the text. Do not draft. Ask a person.
Person required: sending, credits, refunds, deletes.
Owner: Jonah Park.
The earlier spec's send and credit lines are not on this card.

## Anti-patterns

- An agent that sends or pays alone
- Hidden tools
- A task of 'help the team'
