# Grant Narrative

Draft a grant narrative from the funder's questions and the project's real evidence, without inflated impact.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- grant narrative
- proposal narrative
- funder questions
- grant draft

## When not to use this skill

- Fabricated commitments

## Professional boundary

Do not fabricate citations, quotations, data, or participants. Separate evidence you were given from claims that still need a source.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The funder's questions
- The project facts
- Evidence of need and capacity
- What they cannot promise

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Answer the funder's questions in their order.
### 2. Step 2

Use only outcomes the user can support.
### 3. Step 3

Separate past results from hoped-for results.
### 4. Name capacity

who will do the work.
### 5. Step 5

Budget talk must match the budget they supplied. Do not invent costs.
### 6. Step 6

Do not help misstate eligibility or fabricate a partner letter.

## Output

Deliver a **grant narrative draft**.

- Purpose of this grant narrative draft, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Dr. Nia Okonkwo, research lead at Riverbend College in Lethbridge, needs a grant narrative draft by 30 September 2026. A draft claims a partner committed staff, and no letter exists.

### Example data

```text
From: Dr. Nia Okonkwo, research lead
Organization: Riverbend College, Lethbridge
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A draft claims a partner committed staff, and no letter exists.

The funder's questions: A draft claims a partner committed staff, and no letter exists
Evidence of need and capacity: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
What they cannot promise: none written down beyond the ask
```

### Example outcome

**Grant narrative draft**
To: Dr. Nia Okonkwo, research lead, Riverbend College
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Moves the partner to 'in discussion' or cuts the claim.

**From the file**
- The funder's questions: A draft claims a partner committed staff, and no letter exists
- Evidence of need and capacity: one PDF, 2 pages, dated 14 September 2026
- What they cannot promise: none written down beyond the ask

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Dr. Nia Okonkwo by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Fabricated partner letters
- Inflated past results
- Costs that do not match the budget
