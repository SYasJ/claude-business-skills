# Desk Research Brief

Brief desk research so secondary sources are scoped, credited, and not mistaken for primary proof.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- desk research
- secondary research
- landscape scan
- background research

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not fabricate citations, quotations, data, or participants. Separate evidence you were given from claims that still need a source.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The decision
- Sources they can use
- Time
- What would count as good enough

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Define the decision and the facts that would change it.
### 2. Step 2

List source types they will accept.
### 3. Step 3

Credit every fact with the source they found. Unknown stays unknown.
### 4. Step 4

Separate a vendor's marketing from independent reporting.
### 5. Step 5

Stop when the decision is informed or the time box ends.
### 6. Step 6

Do not present desk research as a customer study.

## Output

Deliver a **desk research brief**.

- Purpose of this desk research brief, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Dr. Nia Okonkwo, research lead at Riverbend College in Lethbridge, needs a desk research brief by 30 September 2026. A landscape scan quotes a vendor's homepage as market share.

### Example data

```text
From: Dr. Nia Okonkwo, research lead
Organization: Riverbend College, Lethbridge
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A landscape scan quotes a vendor's homepage as market share.

The decision: A landscape scan quotes a vendor's homepage as market share
Sources they can use: note from Dr. Nia Okonkwo, 14 September 2026. No outside report
Time: five working days, due 30 September 2026
What would count as good enough: 25 in the last period. No prior period attached, so no trend
```

### Example outcome

**Desk research brief**
To: Dr. Nia Okonkwo, research lead, Riverbend College
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Labels the homepage as a claim, not as market share, and lists the missing independent source.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The decision | A landscape scan quotes a vendor's homepage as market share | Needs confirmation |
| Sources they can use | note from Dr. Nia Okonkwo, 14 September 2026. No outside report | Carried into the draft |
| Time | five working days, due 30 September 2026 | Carried into the draft |
| What would count as good enough | 25 in the last period. No prior period attached, so no trend | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Define the decision and the facts that would change it**

**2. List source types they will accept**

**3. Credit every fact with the source they found. Unknown stays unknown**

**4. Separate a vendor's marketing from independent reporting**

**5. Stop when the decision is informed or the time box ends**

**Deliberately not done**
- Vendor copy treated as independent proof.
- Unsourced facts.
- Desk research sold as interviews.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Dr. Nia Okonkwo by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Vendor copy treated as independent proof
- Unsourced facts
- Desk research sold as interviews
