# Email Lifecycle

Design a lifecycle email for one moment, with a true trigger, a useful message, and an honest unsubscribe path.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- lifecycle email
- onboarding email
- nurture sequence
- retention email

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent testimonials, reviews, metrics, or claims the user cannot support. Do not draft spam, cloaking, fake scarcity, or impersonation.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The trigger event
- The reader's job at that moment
- The one action
- What must be true in the product before sending

## Workflow


### 1. Trigger

The event is real and timely. Do not email because a quota of sends exists.
### 2. Usefulness

The message helps the reader do the next step. A logo refresh is not a reason to email.
### 3. One action

One link that matters.
### 4. Truth

Do not imply the reader did something they did not do.
### 5. Frequency

Where this mail sits among others, so you do not stack three asks in a day.
### 6. Consent

Include whatever opt-out the user says their policy requires. Do not help hide an unsubscribe.

## Output

Deliver a **lifecycle email spec**.

- Purpose of this lifecycle email spec, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Lena Ortiz, marketing lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a lifecycle email spec by 30 September 2026. Marketing wants an 'we miss you' email to users who were never active, written as if they had a habit.

### Example data

```text
From: Lena Ortiz, marketing lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Marketing wants an 'we miss you' email to users who were never active, written as if they had a habit.

page: the live page
claim: broader than the note
proof: none attached
publish date wanted: 19 Sep 2026
```

### Example outcome

**Draft the reader can send**

Lena Ortiz — Fieldnote
14 September 2026

Hello,

Refuses the fake habit and either changes the trigger or stops the send. This note uses only the facts in the file from 14 September 2026. It does not add a result, a quote, or a discount that was not supplied.

The open point is still open. I will confirm it before 30 September 2026.

marketing lead, Fieldnote
