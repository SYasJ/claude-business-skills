# Launch Plan

Plan a launch as a coordinated set of proofs, enablement, and a rollback, not as a single announcement.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- launch plan
- product launch
- go-live marketing
- announcement plan

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent testimonials, reviews, metrics, or claims the user cannot support. Do not draft spam, cloaking, fake scarcity, or impersonation.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- What is actually shipping
- The audience
- The date
- Risks and support readiness

## Workflow


### 1. Scope

Describe what a customer can do on launch day. Cut anything that is not ready from the announcement.
### 2. Audience and offer

Who is invited first, and what they are asked to do.
### 3. Enablement

Sales and support get the true scope, limits, and FAQ before the public post.
### 4. Proof

The story, screenshot, or customer quote that is approved. No placeholder quote.
### 5. Rollback

What you will say and do if the launch fails technically or the claim is wrong.
### 6. Readout

The date you will judge the launch against a pre-written success signal.

## Output

Deliver a **launch plan**.

- Purpose of this launch plan, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Lena Ortiz, marketing lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a launch plan by 30 September 2026. Marketing wants a public launch of a feature that still fails in the main browser.

### Example data

```text
From: Lena Ortiz, marketing lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Marketing wants a public launch of a feature that still fails in the main browser.

The audience: people who already buy from Fieldnote
The date: 30 September 2026
Risks and support readiness: Fall service page is open. No score in the file
```

### Example outcome

**Launch plan**
To: Lena Ortiz, marketing lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Holds the public claim, briefs support on the limit, and defines the rollback line.

**From the file**
- The audience: people who already buy from Fieldnote
- The date: 30 September 2026
- Risks and support readiness: Fall service page is open. No score in the file

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Lena Ortiz by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Announcing a feature that is not ready.
- A fake customer quote.
- No support briefing.
