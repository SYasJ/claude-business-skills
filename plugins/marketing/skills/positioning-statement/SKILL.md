# Positioning Statement

Write a positioning statement that names the buyer, the alternative, and the difference you can prove.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- positioning
- positioning statement
- who is this for
- category message

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Do not invent testimonials, reviews, metrics, or claims the user cannot support. Do not draft spam, cloaking, fake scarcity, or impersonation.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The primary buyer
- The alternative they use today
- The difference you can prove
- Buyers you will not serve

## Workflow


### 1. Buyer

One primary buyer. A statement for everyone is a statement for no one.
### 2. Alternative

Include the status quo. Name a vendor only if the user supplied that competitor.
### 3. Difference

One difference that matters to the buyer's job and that the user can evidence.
### 4. Proof

The evidence sits next to the difference. If proof is missing, the positioning is a hypothesis.
### 5. Boundary

Who it is not for. That line protects sales from bad-fit deals.
### 6. Length

A short statement plus a paragraph. No manifesto.

## Output

Deliver a **positioning statement**.

- Purpose of this positioning statement, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Lena Ortiz, marketing lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a positioning statement by 30 September 2026. A team says they are the 'AI platform for business' and cannot name the buyer or the alternative.

### Example data

```text
From: Lena Ortiz, marketing lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A team says they are the 'AI platform for business' and cannot name the buyer or the alternative.

The primary buyer: Kite Freight
The alternative they use today: two deals cited from memory. Neither has a written loss reason
The difference you can prove: Fall service page, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached
Buyers you will not serve: Fall service page. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else
```

### Example outcome

**Positioning statement**
To: Lena Ortiz, marketing lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
A statement aimed at one buyer, with the spreadsheet or incumbent they actually replace, and a hypothesis label if proof is thin.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The primary buyer | Kite Freight | Needs confirmation |
| The alternative they use today | two deals cited from memory. Neither has a written loss reason | Carried into the draft |
| The difference you can prove | Fall service page, recorded 14 September 2026. No supporting file attached | Carried into the draft |
| Buyers you will not serve | Fall service page. Stated in the ask, not documented anywhere else | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Buyer**  
One primary buyer. A statement for everyone is a statement for no one.

**2. Alternative**  
Include the status quo. Name a vendor only if the user supplied that competitor.

**3. Difference**  
One difference that matters to the buyer's job and that the user can evidence.

**4. Proof**  
The evidence sits next to the difference. If proof is missing, the positioning is a hypothesis.

**5. Boundary**  
Who it is not for. That line protects sales from bad-fit deals.

**Deliberately not done**
- Positioning for everyone.
- A difference you cannot prove.
- A category claim copied from a larger company.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Lena Ortiz by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Positioning for everyone.
- A difference you cannot prove.
- A category claim copied from a larger company.
