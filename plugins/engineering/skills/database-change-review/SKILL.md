# Database Change Review

Review a schema or data change for safety, rollback, and lock risk before it reaches production.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- schema review
- migration review
- database change
- backfill review

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Prefer the repository's existing patterns. Do not disable security controls, invent credentials, or introduce network calls the user did not ask for.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The change
- Table size and traffic if known
- Rollback idea
- Data correctness risk

## Workflow


### 1. Intent

What user or reporting problem the change serves.
### 2. Safety

Locks, rewrites, and nullability. If size is unknown, say the risk is unknown rather than approving.
### 3. Backfill

How existing rows become valid. A constraint added before a backfill is a finding.
### 4. Rollback

How to get back, or an explicit statement that the change is forward-only and who accepts that.
### 5. Observability

What to watch during the migration.
### 6. Secrets

No production connection strings in the review notes. Ask for redacted plans.

## Output

Deliver a **database change review**.

- Purpose of this database change review, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Aisha Rahman, engineering lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a database change review by 30 September 2026. A migration adds a NOT NULL column with a default on a table of unknown size and has no rollback.

### Example data

```text
From: Aisha Rahman, engineering lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A migration adds a NOT NULL column with a default on a table of unknown size and has no rollback.

branch: main, change not merged
tests listed: none
rollback: not written
owner: the person who opened the change
```

### Example outcome

**Database change review**
To: Aisha Rahman, engineering lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026 · Needed by: 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Marks risk unknown, requires a batched plan, and rejects credential pasting.

**What the file supports**

| Input | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| branch | main, change not merged | Needs confirmation |
| tests listed | none | Carried into the draft |
| rollback | not written | Carried into the draft |
| owner | the person who opened the change | Needs confirmation |

**How this draft was built**

**1. Intent**  
What user or reporting problem the change serves.

**2. Safety**  
Locks, rewrites, and nullability. If size is unknown, say the risk is unknown rather than approving.

**3. Backfill**  
How existing rows become valid. A constraint added before a backfill is a finding.

**4. Rollback**  
How to get back, or an explicit statement that the change is forward-only and who accepts that.

**5. Observability**  
What to watch during the migration.

**Deliberately not done**
- Approving a lock-heavy migration with unknown table size.
- A constraint before the backfill.
- Pasting production credentials into the plan.

**Open items for a human**
- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.

Next: Aisha Rahman by 30 September 2026. This is a draft, not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Approving a lock-heavy migration with unknown table size.
- A constraint before the backfill.
- Pasting production credentials into the plan.
