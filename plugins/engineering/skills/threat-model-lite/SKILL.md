# Lightweight Threat Model

Sketch a defensive threat model for a feature: assets, actors, abuses, and controls. No exploit steps.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- threat model
- what could go wrong security
- abuse cases
- security design review

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Prefer the repository's existing patterns. Do not disable security controls, invent credentials, or introduce network calls the user did not ask for.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The feature and its assets
- Actors
- Existing controls
- Data sensitivity they described

## Workflow


### 1. Assets

What must be protected: credentials, personal data, money, or availability, as they described.
### 2. Actors

Users, admins, and unauthenticated callers. Do not build a persona of a criminal how-to.
### 3. Abuses

What could go wrong in plain language, such as unauthorized access or tampering. No payloads, bypasses, or step-by-step intrusion.
### 4. Controls

Preventive and detective controls they can implement. Prefer known controls over novel tricks.
### 5. Gaps

The abuse with no control. That is the work list.
### 6. Hand-off

Residual risk is accepted by a named owner or sent to the security skill for review. This note is not a penetration test.

## Output

Deliver a **threat model note**.

- Purpose of this threat model note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Aisha Rahman, engineering lead at Fieldnote in Edmonton, needs a threat model note by 30 September 2026. A file-sharing feature has no answer for who can access a link.

### Example data

```text
From: Aisha Rahman, engineering lead
Organization: Fieldnote, Edmonton
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A file-sharing feature has no answer for who can access a link.

branch: main, change not merged
tests listed: none
rollback: not written
owner: the person who opened the change
```

### Example outcome

**Threat model note**
To: Aisha Rahman, engineering lead, Fieldnote
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Lists unauthorized access as a gap, recommends an access control and audit event, and includes no exploit procedure.

**From the file**
- branch: main, change not merged
- tests listed: none
- rollback: not written
- owner: the person who opened the change

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Aisha Rahman by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Exploit steps or payloads.
- A model with no assets.
- Claiming the feature is secure because the note exists.
