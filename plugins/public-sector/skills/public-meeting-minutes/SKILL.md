# Public Meeting Minutes

Draft minutes of a public meeting that record motions, votes, and conflicts.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- public minutes
- council minutes
- board minutes public
- meeting record

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Public work should be accurate, even-handed, and suitable for the record. Do not draft deceptive communications, voter manipulation, or surveillance programs.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The agenda
- Motions and votes they recorded
- Conflicts declared
- The approver

## Workflow


### 1. Step 1

Record motions and votes as given.
### 2. Step 2

Note declared conflicts.
### 3. Step 3

Do not invent attendance or a vote.
### 4. Step 4

Summarize discussion without caricature.
### 5. Step 5

Mark the draft for the clerk or chair to approve.
### 6. Step 6

Keep the tone suitable for the public record.

## Output

Deliver a **public minutes**.

- Purpose of this public minutes, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

**1. Record motions and votes as given**

**2. Note declared conflicts**

**3. Do not invent attendance or a vote**

- Confirm every row marked *Needs confirmation* above before this leaves draft.
- Anything absent from the file stayed absent. No figure, date, or name was supplied from outside it.
