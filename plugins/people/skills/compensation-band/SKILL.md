# Compensation Band Review

Review a pay decision against the band and the evidence, without inventing market rates.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- pay band
- compensation review
- salary band
- offer versus band

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Employment work must follow the organization's policies and local employment law. Do not invent legal requirements. Do not write content that discriminates or retaliates.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The band if they have one
- The proposed pay
- The evidence for the person's level
- Internal peers the user chooses to include

## Workflow


### 1. Start with their band

If no band exists, say the decision is discretionary and do not invent market percentiles.
### 2. Level evidence

Does the person's work match the level definition they provided. Pay does not define level after the fact.
### 3. Internal consistency

Compare only with peers the user supplied. Do not guess what others are paid.
### 4. Range placement

Where the proposal sits in the band, and what would justify an exception.
### 5. Exception log

If they go outside the band, name the approver and the review date.
### 6. No market theater

You may list questions for a compensation consultant. You do not fabricate a survey number.

## Output

Deliver a **compensation review note**.

- Purpose of this compensation review note, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Chris Adeyemi, people lead at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a compensation review note by 30 September 2026. A manager wants to beat a competitor's verbal offer and the proposal sits above the band.

### Example data

```text
From: Chris Adeyemi, people lead
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A manager wants to beat a competitor's verbal offer and the proposal sits above the band.

cadence: weekly, 30 minutes, Tuesday 10:00
status board: already updated daily
last meeting: 6 status questions, employee did not set the agenda
growth topic: none written down
```

### Example outcome

**Compensation review note**
To: Chris Adeyemi, people lead, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Places the proposal above the band, requires an approver, and does not invent a market percentile.

**From the file**
- cadence: weekly, 30 minutes, Tuesday 10:00
- status board: already updated daily
- last meeting: 6 status questions, employee did not set the agenda
- growth topic: none written down

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Chris Adeyemi by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Invented percentile data.
- A raise justified only by a competing anecdote with no band.
- Comparing to peers the user did not authorize you to discuss.
