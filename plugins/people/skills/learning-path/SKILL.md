# Learning Path

Build a learning path for a role from the work, with practice tasks rather than a course catalog.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- learning path
- upskilling plan
- training plan for a role
- skill development plan

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Employment work must follow the organization's policies and local employment law. Do not invent legal requirements. Do not write content that discriminates or retaliates.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The skill gap in work terms
- Time available per week
- Real tasks they can practice on
- How proficiency will be judged

## Workflow


### 1. Define proficiency

What the person will be able to do, observed on the job. Course completion is not proficiency.
### 2. Sequence

Foundations, guided practice, then independent work. Skip modules that do not serve the gap.
### 3. Use real work

Prefer a sanitized piece of their actual work over a generic exercise.
### 4. Time box

Fit the path to the weekly time they have. A 40-hour plan for someone with two hours is not a plan.
### 5. Coach

Who reviews the practice. A path with no reviewer is content, not development.
### 6. Stop rule

If the gap is actually a job-design problem, say so instead of training someone to survive a broken role.

## Output

Deliver a **learning path**.

- Purpose of this learning path, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Chris Adeyemi, people lead at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a learning path by 30 September 2026. An analyst is told to 'learn finance' in a month while closing the books full time.

### Example data

```text
From: Chris Adeyemi, people lead
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

An analyst is told to 'learn finance' in a month while closing the books full time.

cadence: weekly, 30 minutes, Tuesday 10:00
status board: already updated daily
last meeting: 6 status questions, employee did not set the agenda
growth topic: none written down
```

### Example outcome

**Learning path**
To: Chris Adeyemi, people lead, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
The time budget does not fit a broad finance education.

**From the file**
- cadence: weekly, 30 minutes, Tuesday 10:00
- status board: already updated daily
- last meeting: 6 status questions, employee did not set the agenda
- growth topic: none written down

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Chris Adeyemi by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- A course catalog dump.
- Completion certificates as the goal.
- Ignoring an impossible workload.
