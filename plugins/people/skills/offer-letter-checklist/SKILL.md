# Offer Checklist

Prepare an offer checklist so compensation, start date, and conditions are complete before anyone celebrates.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- offer letter
- prepare an offer
- offer checklist
- verbal offer

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Employment work must follow the organization's policies and local employment law. Do not invent legal requirements. Do not write content that discriminates or retaliates.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Role and level
- Compensation parts the company intends
- Start date and contingencies
- Approver

## Workflow


### 1. List the parts

Base, variable, equity if any, and benefits status. Do not invent numbers or equity values.
### 2. Contingencies

Background, work authorization, or other checks only if the user says they are part of the process. Do not invent a check.
### 3. Manager alignment

The hiring manager and the approver agree on level and pay band. If they do not, stop the checklist and surface the conflict.
### 4. Candidate-facing clarity

What is guaranteed versus discretionary, in plain language.
### 5. Expiration

An offer date and a response date the user chooses. Do not create false urgency.
### 6. Counsel and HR own the letter

This skill checks completeness. It does not declare the letter legally sufficient.

## Output

Deliver a **offer checklist**.

- Purpose of this offer checklist, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Chris Adeyemi, people lead at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs an offer checklist by 30 September 2026. A manager told a candidate a number on a call, and finance has not approved the band.

### Example data

```text
From: Chris Adeyemi, people lead
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

A manager told a candidate a number on a call, and finance has not approved the band.

Role and level: Jordan Hale and one other, both unconfirmed as of 14 September 2026
Compensation parts the company intends: base CAD 60,000. Bonus line blank
Start date and contingencies: 30 September 2026
Approver: Chris Adeyemi. They have not signed
```

### Example outcome

**Offer checklist**
Northline Studio · 14 September 2026 · Due 30 September 2026

**Decision**
Blocks the letter until the band is approved and lists the verbal number as not yet an offer.

**Checklist**

- [x] **Role and level** — Jordan Hale and one other, both unconfirmed as of 14 September 2026  
      Evidenced in the file
- [x] **Compensation parts the company intends** — base CAD 60,000. Bonus line blank  
      Evidenced in the file
- [x] **Start date and contingencies** — 30 September 2026  
      Evidenced in the file
- [ ] **Approver** — Chris Adeyemi. They have not signed  
      Open — nothing in the file closes this

**The gates this list enforces, in order**

1. List the parts
2. Contingencies
3. Manager alignment
4. Candidate-facing clarity
5. Expiration

**Deliberately not done**
- A verbal offer that omits variable-pay conditions.
- Invented equity value.
- False exploding-offer pressure.

**Stop rule**
Do not mark this pack complete while a box above is open. An open box is a finding, not a formality — it is the thing this checklist exists to catch.

Next: Chris Adeyemi closes the open items before 30 September 2026.

## Anti-patterns

- A verbal offer that omits variable-pay conditions.
- Invented equity value.
- False exploding-offer pressure.
