# Handbook Policy Draft

Draft a short handbook policy in plain language, marked for HR and counsel before publication.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- employee handbook
- HR policy draft
- workplace policy
- code of conduct section

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Employment work must follow the organization's policies and local employment law. Do not invent legal requirements. Do not write content that discriminates or retaliates.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- The behavior the policy must guide
- The current practice
- Who enforces it
- Jurisdictions they say it must cover

## Workflow


### 1. Purpose

Why the policy exists for the workplace, in a few lines.
### 2. Rules

What people should do, in plain language. Avoid legalese copied from a mega-corporation.
### 3. Exceptions and reports

How to ask for an exception and how to report a breach, using their channels.
### 4. Consequences

Only the consequence types they say exist. Do not invent dismissal language as a legal fact.
### 5. Counsel flag

Note that local employment law may change the policy. The draft is not published as-is.
### 6. Length

One or two pages. A policy nobody reads will not guide behavior.

## Output

Deliver a **handbook policy draft**.

- Purpose of this handbook policy draft, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.
