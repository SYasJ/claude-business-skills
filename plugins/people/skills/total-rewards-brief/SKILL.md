# Total Rewards Brief

Explain a person's total rewards in plain language using only components the company actually offers.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user:

- total rewards
- benefits explanation
- comp statement
- rewards brief

## When not to use this skill

- The user wants a different domain's specialist skill.
- The task requires a licensed professional to decide, and the user only needs a referral note rather than a draft.
- The request asks you to deceive, evade a control, or hide material facts.

## Professional boundary

Employment work must follow the organization's policies and local employment law. Do not invent legal requirements. Do not write content that discriminates or retaliates.

## Operating boundaries

- Use only information the user provides or files they explicitly ask you to read. Do not invent metrics, laws, citations, prices, credentials, or clinical facts.
- Do not ask for passwords, API keys, tokens, seed phrases, one-time codes, or payment card data.
- Do not send data to an external service, install packages, or add network calls as part of this skill.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and recommendations. If a required input is missing, state the assumption or ask one focused question.
- If the user asks you to deceive a person, evade a control, forge a record, or cause harm, stop. Offer a legitimate alternative.
- Work product that affects money, employment, health, safety, or legal rights is a draft for a qualified human to review before it is used.

## Inputs to collect

- Components the company offers
- The person's eligible parts
- What must not be promised
- Questions employees keep asking

## Workflow


### 1. List real components

Pay, variable, time off, and benefits they confirmed. Do not add perks from other companies.
### 2. Separate guaranteed from variable

A bonus target is not a promise unless they say it is guaranteed.
### 3. Equity

Describe it only to the extent they explained vesting and value. Do not invent a share price.
### 4. Plain language

Write the explanation an employee can read without a glossary.
### 5. Questions

Answer only what policy answers. The rest go to HR. Do not give tax advice on benefits.
### 6. Privacy

Do not include another employee's pay in the brief.

## Output

Deliver a **total rewards brief**.

- Purpose of this total rewards brief, in two sentences.
- Facts the user supplied, listed separately from assumptions.
- The work itself, in the structure the workflow names.
- Open questions, risks, and the single next action with an owner.
- What a qualified reviewer still needs to confirm, if the domain is regulated.

## Quality bar

- Every number, date, name, and citation came from the user or is marked as an assumption.
- The artifact can be used without reading this skill again.
- Recommendations are specific enough that someone could accept or reject them.
- Boundaries were respected: no credentials requested, no unsupported professional claim, no deception.

## Example

### Scenario

Chris Adeyemi, people lead at Northline Studio in Calgary, needs a total rewards brief by 30 September 2026. Employees think the target bonus is guaranteed because the offer conversation was casual.

### Example data

```text
From: Chris Adeyemi, people lead
Organization: Northline Studio, Calgary
Date: 14 September 2026
Needed by: 30 September 2026

Employees think the target bonus is guaranteed because the offer conversation was casual.

Components the company offers: CAD 120, dates not set, cap not set
What must not be promised: none written down beyond the ask
Questions employees keep asking: Employees think the target bonus is guaranteed because the offer conversation was casual
```

### Example outcome

**Total rewards brief**
To: Chris Adeyemi, people lead, Northline Studio
Date: 14 September 2026

**Decision**
Shows the target as variable, lists only real benefits, and sends tax questions to a qualified advisor.

**From the file**
- Components the company offers: CAD 120, dates not set, cap not set
- What must not be promised: none written down beyond the ask
- Questions employees keep asking: Employees think the target bonus is guaranteed because the offer conversation was casual

Nothing in this draft was added from outside that file.
Next: Chris Adeyemi by 30 September 2026. This is not a sign-off.

## Anti-patterns

- Implied guarantees.
